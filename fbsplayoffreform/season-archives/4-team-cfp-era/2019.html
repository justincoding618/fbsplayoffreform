    <h1>2019-20 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2019 season was the sixth season of the 4-team CFP. Fittingly, this
      season produced no controversy of which teams would play for a National
      Championship. However, the CFP rankings has continued to undervalue
      non-power FBS teams. AAC Champion Memphis (12-1), Mountain West Champion
      Boise State (12-1), and Sun Belt Champion Appalachian State (12-1) were
      all ranked in the CFP Top 20. Cincinnati (10-3) and Navy (10-2) were also
      ranked in the CFP Top 25. However, had Navy lost to Army, it would have
      been too late for the CFP to drop Navy out of the rankings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The 2019 season was another best for conference champions.  Out of the 10 conference champions, 8 were ranked in the final CFP top 20!  In addition, because all conferences do their conference championship games, all were undisputed.  The first-round matchups would then look like the following for the 2019 season (teams in bold are hosts):

    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Air Force (10-2)</td>
          <td>Indiana (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Kansas St (8-4)</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Temple (8-4)</td>
          <td>San Diego St (9-3)</td>

    <p>With 8 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 17 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the five best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25.  SMU, along with Air Force, Kansas State, Temple, and UCF, claimed the final five at-large spots.  SMU clinches one of the last at-large spots as their 1-2 record against playoff-bound teams with no bad losses stood out.  Their best win is vs Temple (who also got one of the last playoff spots as well).  
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Temple, they along with Kansas State, UCF, and Air Force claim the last playoff spots.  Although Temple has a bad loss to Buffalo, it has gone 1-3 against playoff-bound teams.  Their only win was vs the AAC Champion Memphis (who got the conference's automatic bid).  That win was enough to propel them into one of the final teams in.  Kansas State also had a stronger case as well.  Although they too have a bad loss to West Virginia, despite going 1-3 against playoff-bound teams, their biggest signature win came by defeating Big 12 Champion Oklahoma.  That win was enough to propel them into one of the final teams in.  UCF had two bad losses to Tulsa and Pittsburgh.  However, their 1-1 record vs playoff-bound teams (with a win vs Temple) was enough for them to claim one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last playoff spot was very dicey as the best remaining teams do not have a win vs playoff-bound competition.  However, Air Force gets the final playoff spot as although they were 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams, their win vs Hawaii (who played for the Mountain West Championship) along with no bad losses was enough to propel them to the final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out did not have any wins against playoff bound teams.  Indiana's record was impressive.  However, despite no bad losses, they went 0-4 vs playoff-bound competition.  San Diego State's record was not impressive at all.  Along with losing to West Division Champion Hawaii, they have also picked up bad losses to Utah State and Nevada.  Because they did not play any team that were playoff-bound, they were among the first teams out.  Virginia Tech did not pick up any wins vs playoff-bound competition.  They were 0-2 when presented with the opportunity. However, they also picked up bad losses to Boston College and Duke, putting them among the first teams out.  Finally, Louisiana was impressive in taking care of business.  However, they lost both meetings vs Sun Belt Champion Appalachian State and also picked up a bad loss to Mississippi State.
