    <h1>2018-19 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>The 2018 season was the fifth season of the 4-team CFP.  However, the system still had some controversies.
      <ul>
        <li>Ohio State was left out of the playoff field in favor of Big 12 Champion Oklahoma (12-1).  Georgia also ranked ahead of Ohio State in the final CFP rankings. Had Alabama lost in the SEC title game, they would have likely been ranked ahead of Ohio State as well (and would have likely gotten in over Oklahoma).</li>
        <li>AAC Champion UCF (12-0) was ranked #8 in the CFP rankings, but were once again never given a chance to play for a National Championship due to their perceived weak schedule.  They lost to LSU in the Fiesta Bowl.</li>
        <li>The CFP overlooked Army (10-2) and Sun Belt Champion Appalachian State (10-2) due to their perceived weak schedule.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>

          <td>Army (10-2)</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Oregon (8-4)</td>

    <p>With 7 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 18 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25.  Georgia Southern, Oregon, Stanford, and Troy were among the final teams to clinch a playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford stood out the most out of the bubble teams.  While Stanford went just 1-4 vs playoff bound teams, their win against Oregon was just enough to clinch one of the final playoff spots.  Speaking of Oregon, Oregon gets in by getting a signature win against Pac-12 Champion Washington.  While their bad loss to Arizona does stand out, going 1-3 vs playoff bound teams was enough to get them into the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Sun Belt teams each had one bad loss.  However, they also had signature wins that propelled them to make it into the field.  Troy only went 1-2 vs playoff bound teams.  However, their win against Georgia Southern was enough to overcome their bad loss to Liberty and propel them into the field.  Georgia Southern, on the other hand, gained their signature win against Sun Belt Champion Appalachian State.  Although they too went 1-2 vs playoff bound teams with a bad loss to ULM, their win against Appalachian state was enough for them to get into the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out had impressive overall records.  However, none of them have wins against playoff bound teams.  While Utah State, Cincinnati and Army were impressive in winning ten games, they were not able to close out against their only opportunities vs their playoff bound teams.  Army and Utah State also have picked up bad losses.  Army has a bad loss to Duke that could not overcome their lackluster resume.  The same for Utah State with their bad loss to Michigan State.  Cincinnati had no bad losses, but they could not get into the field due to the lack of wins vs playoff bound teams. NC State went 0-2 vs playoff bound teams, also picking up a bad loss to Wake Forest.  Overall, these teams did not have enough justification to be included in the playoff field.
