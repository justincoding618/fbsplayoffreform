    <h1>2006-07 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2006 season was the ninth season of the BCS. However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>Boise State, Florida, Michigan, Louisville, USC, and Wisconsin were in contention to play for a National Championship.  However, Louisville and Boise State were not highly considered, while Wisconsin (whose only loss was to Michigan) was two steps behind Ohio State.</li>
        <li>Michigan lost to Ohio State in an instant classic (which gave Ohio State the Big Ten Championship).  However, they were still in contention to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>Florida was able to win the SEC Championship Game, while USC fell in their final game of the season against UCLA.  This left with Florida and Michigan as the two remaining contenders to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>The computer polls had Florida and Michigan tied for #2.  However, thanks to the human polls, Florida was able to just edge out Michigan to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>Michigan earned a spot in the Rose Bowl, while Boise State became the second non-AQ team to play in a BCS bowl.</li>
        <li>The BCS had a rule where only two teams from each AQ conference were allowed to play in bowl games.  This left 11-1 Wisconsin and 10-2 Auburn out of the BCS bowl rotation.  If the rule was omitted, Wisconsin would have gotten the final at-large BCS bid (while Auburn would still be left out of a BCS bowl).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2006 season marked the fourth season where the BCS ranked the top 25.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.   
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <p>
      In the Pac-10, USC and Cal both shared the conference title.  However, USC would earn the Pac-10’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Cal.  The same would apply in the Sun Belt.  Troy would earn the Sun Belt’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Middle Tennessee.  
    </p>  
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:</p>

          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>

    <p>
      With 8 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 17 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This was enough for four at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Maryland were able to claim the final at-large spots.  Despite picking up a bad loss to South Carolina and going 1-3 vs playoff-bound teams, Clemson picked up a win vs Georgia Tech (who played in the ACC Championship Game) was enough to propel them into one of the final playoff spots.  Georgia's bad losses to Vanderbilt and Kentucky does stand out.  However, their 2-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, which included wins vs Georgia Tech and Auburn gave them one of the final playoff spots.  Georgia Tech was in danger of missing the playoff field after losing the ACC Championship game.  However, despite going 1-4 vs playoff-bound teams, their win vs Virginia Tech was just enough for them to make the field.  Maryland was able to just claim that final playoff spot thanks to their win vs Clemson and no bad losses despite their 1-4 record vs playoff-bound teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Penn State went 0-4 vs playoff-bound teams, which just places them among the first teams out.  Hawaii was just on their way to a playoff spot.  However, their regular season ending loss to Oregon State that dropped their record to 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams as well as their bad loss to Alabama kept them out of the field.  South Florida did have a case with their signature win vs West Virginia.  However, their bad losses to Kansas and Cincinnati prevented them from making it into the field.  TCU's lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams also kept them out of the playoff field.
