    <h1>2005-06 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2005 season was the eighth season of the BCS. This season was one of
      the only seasons where the BCS put the right top two teams to play for a
      National Championship.  However, on June 10, 2010, USC had to vacate their entire 2005 season (along with their last two wins of the 2004 season) due to the improper benefits with Reggie Bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2005 season marked the third season where the BCS ranked the top 25. In addition, it is also the first season where the Harris Polls were used to determine the BCS rankings.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.

    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      In the Big Ten, Penn State and Ohio State both shared the conference title.  However, Penn State would earn the Big Ten’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Ohio State.  The same would apply in the WAC.  Boise State would earn the WAC’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Nevada.  The Sun Belt had a three-way tie for first place.  Because each were tied through their respective common conference opponents, the tie was broken via the average computer rankings between Anderson & Hester (A&H), Billingsley (Bill.), Colley Matrix (CM), Massey (Mass.), Sagarin (Sag.), and Wolfe.  The Sun Belt tie-breaker went as follows:

    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      With 7 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 18 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This left us with only three at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. Northwestern would clinch one of the final four at-large spots in virtue of being ranked number 25 in the BCS rankings.  Although they had a bad loss to Arizona State, going 2-3 vs playoff-bound teams, which include wins vs Iowa and Wisconsin were enough for the computers to rank them in the final regular season BCS Standings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Iowa, they along with Minnesota and Clemson claim the final playoff spots. Iowa was also able to go 2-3 vs playoff-bound teams, with their wins vs Wisconsin and Minnesota just enough to put them among the last teams in.  Minnesota went 1-3 vs playoff-bound teams, but their win vs Michigan was just enough to put them among the last teams in.  Clemson also went 1-3 vs playoff-bound teams and was in danger of not making the playoff field.  However, despite their bad loss to Wake Forest, their win vs ACC Champion Florida State, along with their head-to-head tie-breaker vs South Carolina was enough to put them as one of the last teams in. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Iowa State and Nebraska were plagued by a weakened Big 12 North Division.  Iowa just barely making the playoff field placed Iowa State in a bad position.  Despite their head-to-head tie-breaker over Iowa, Iowa State's bad losses to Missouri and Baylor were enough to put them among the first teams out.  Nebraska was able to pick up a big win vs Iowa State.  However, bad losses to Missouri and Kansas were also enough to put them among the first teams out.  South Carolina has the most legitimate case to be included in the field.  However, their 1-4 record vs playoff-bound teams (which included the regular-season ending loss to Clemson) was enough to put them among the first teams out.  Nevada would have been another non-power FBS team to be in the field.  However, their lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams kept them out of the field.
