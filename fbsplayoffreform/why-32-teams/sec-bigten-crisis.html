    <h1>The Crisis Hovering in College Football</h1>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten are at a crossroads. After not agreeing to a format,
      the playoff stayed at 12 teams for at least another season. However, the
      impasse goes beyond college football. Despite forming an alliance in
      February 2024, we saw that it fractured quickly as the SEC and Big Ten
      went in different directions. How did we get to this point? Let's start
      with the recent conference alignment that plagued college football.
    </p>
    <h2>Conference Realignment of 2020s</h2>
    <h3>SEC Expands with Oklahoma and Texas</h3>
    <p>
      The new conference realignment paved the comeback of super conferences.
      Texas and Oklahoma, the Big 12’s two biggest athletic brands, were looking
      to join a new conference. Both wanted to leave the Big 12 in order to
      expand their brand. They reached out to the Southeastern Conference to
      become new members of the conference. On July 29, 2021, the SEC members
      unanimously approve to invite Texas and Oklahoma to join the SEC. Both
      approved their invitations the next day, expanding the SEC from 14 teams
      to 16 teams beginning on July 1, 2025, making a return to Super
      Conferences. However, Texas, Oklahoma, and the Big 12 eventually agreed to
      let the Red River Rivals join the SEC beginning on July 1, 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight remaining Big 12 teams stood pat and looked into the best teams
      from the non-Power FBS conferences as expansion candidates. About six
      weeks after Texas and Oklahoma announced their intentions to join the SEC,
      the eight remaining Big 12 teams unanimously approved extending
      invitations to FBS Independent BYU and AAC members Cincinnati, Houston,
      and UCF. BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF all accepted to join the Big
      12. On June 15, 2022, they agreed to move there beginning the 2023 FBS
      season.
    </p>
    <h3>The Pac 12's Collapse and Rebuild</h3>
    <p>
      About 11 months after Texas and Oklahoma made their move to the SEC, the
      Big Ten received a gift from two Los Angeles universities. On June 30,
      2022, USC and UCLA officially decided to leave the Pac-12 to join the Big
      Ten beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. Big Ten members unanimously
      approved inviting USC and UCLA. The move to the Big Ten increased the Big
      Ten membership to 16 teams. The Big Ten now have schools that go across
      the country. USC and UCLA’s move stunned the college athletic landscape as
      the Pac-12 loses two of their biggest brands to the Big Ten. The UC Board
      of Reagents eventually approved UCLA’s move to the Big Ten on December 14,
      2022.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conference realignment continued in Summer 2023. The Pac-12 was truly
      gutted in 6 weeks. On July 27, 2023, the Big 12 unanimously welcomed back
      Colorado, which went into effect in August 2024. The Pac-12 attempted to
      keep their remaining members together. However, one week later, their
      effort failed as five more members departed to different conferences. On
      August 4, 2023, the Big Ten greeted Oregon and Washington to join their
      conference starting in August 2024. The Big Ten became the largest Power
      Conference at the time with 18 members. The Big 12 acclimated Arizona,
      Arizona State, and Utah, which now increased to 16 members beginning in
      July 2024. On September 1, 2023, Stanford and California became members of
      the ACC beginning in August 2024. SMU also became an ACC member as well
      beginning in July 2024. The ACC increased their membership to 17 full
      football members. Counting Notre Dame’s membership as a full non-football
      member, they tie the Big Ten with 18 members overall.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many of its members left for different conferences, the Pac-12
      rebuilt their brand. Oregon State and Washington State reached a
      settlement with the ten departing Pac-12 members for control of what’s
      left of the Pac-12 and rebuild the conference. On December 1, 2023, Oregon
      State and Washington State formed a temporary alliance with the Mountain
      West, where each would play 6 Mountain West teams and five Power
      conference teams plus one FCS team, but only for 2024. Even though the
      extension of the agreement fell through, Oregon State and Washington State
      are still both committed to rebuilding the Pac-12. On September 12, 2024,
      Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, and San Diego State will join
      the Pac-12 beginning in July 2026. Utah State pledged to join the Pac-12
      12 days later. Although they have added Gonzaga as a full non-football
      member, they still needed at least one more full football member to join
      the conference. On June 30, 2025, Texas State officially made their
      decision to leave the Sun Belt for the Pac-12. The Pac-12 completed their
      rebuild and survived. However, they could still be looking to add more
      members in the future.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Conference Responses</h3>
    <p>
      The AAC was able to backfill after losing Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF. On
      October 21, 2021, the AAC invited UAB, North Texas, Texas-San Antonio
      (UTSA), Florida Atlantic, Charlotte, and Rice from CUSA, where all six of
      them accepted to join. The AAC had an initial different plan. They
      initially wanted to plan a merger with Stanford, California, Oregon State,
      and Washington State. However, after Stanford, California, and SMU decided
      to join the ACC, the AAC decided to no longer pursue the merger. Instead,
      on October 25, 2023, Army decided to end their FBS Independent status and
      joined the AAC as a football affiliate to replace SMU. The Army-Navy game
      still remains as an annual non-conference game. A year after Army joined,
      the AAC rebranded once again as American Conference since July 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mountain West responded to the Pac-12 developments. After losing five
      full members to the Pac-12, the six remaining full members (UNLV, Wyoming,
      Air Force, Nevada, San Jose State, and New Mexico) committed to stay with
      the conference. They were able to elevate Hawaii from football only
      affiliate member to full-time member and recruited UTEP to join their
      conference, giving them enough members to operate as an FBS conference.
      Northern Illinois will join as a Football Affiliate beginning 2026 (and putting their other sports to the
      Horizon League), further stabilizing the conference for now. In addition, 10-time FCS Champion North Dakota State will also join as a Football Affiliate beginning in 2026 (while also keeping all their other sports in the Summit League).  Although they
      were able to also add Grand Canyon and UC-Davis as full non-football
      members, the Mountain West might not be done with expanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      CUSA fought through survivability during this round of realignment. CUSA
      lost nine members to two different conferences throughout October 2021.
      They lost six to the AAC and three more to the Sun Belt. CUSA was able to
      subsist despite the massive exodus. On November 5, 2021, two FBS
      independent members, New Mexico State and Liberty, and two FCS
      universities, Jacksonville State and Sam Houston State, accepted to become
      full members of CUSA. All of these moves took effect on July 1, 2023. On
      October 14, 2022, CUSA scored a major move by adding Kennesaw State (who
      is jumping from FCS to FBS) as a full member of the conference, pushing
      their membership to 10 teams for 2024. A little over a year later, on
      November 28, 2023, Delaware jumped to the FBS level to join CUSA, pushing
      their membership up to 11 teams. On May 10, 2024, Missouri State also made
      the jump to the FBS level to join CUSA, pushing their membership to 12
      teams starting in 2025. However, they will lose two members to different
      conferences. UTEP will leave for the Mountain West in 2026, while
      Louisiana Tech will leave to re-join the Sun Belt no later than 2027.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sun Belt became a beneficiary in conference realignment during the
      2020s. Throughout the rest of October 2021, Southern Miss, Old Dominion,
      and Marshall all announced their intentions to leave CUSA for the Sun
      Belt, and James Madison from the FCS ranks joined in as well. They were
      able to balloon up to 14 members. Although they lost Texas State to the
      Pac-12, they were able to respond by accepting Louisiana Tech as a full
      football member.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MAC had been relatively quiet for most of the conference realignment
      until recently. UMass initially was a MAC-football only affiliate for four
      seasons and still had all their sports in the Atlantic 10 when they first
      moved up to the FBS back in 2011. From 2016-24, UMass football played as
      an FBS Independent, but had little to no success. On February 29, 2024,
      UMass rejoins the MAC as a full member, which goes into effect beginning
      July 1, 2025. With the MAC going away from Divisions, having an odd number
      of teams would be no problem for them. However, that would only last for
      the 2025 season, as Northern Illinois becomes a football only affiliate
      for the Mountain West beginning in 2026.
    </p>
    <h2>CFP Reworks Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      The College Football Playoff underwent its most significant transformation
      since its inception in 2014. On December 1, 2022, the CFP Board of
      Managers unanimously approved expanding from a 4-team playoff to a 12-team
      format beginning with the 2024 season. The decision came after years of
      debate about access and competitive balance, with non-Power conference
      teams rarely receiving invitations to the 4-team playoff despite
      undefeated seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the playoff expansion came with a significant restructuring of
      CFP governance that fundamentally altered the balance of power in college
      football. In March 2024, the CFP signed a six-year, $7.8 billion media
      rights contract with ESPN extending through the 2031-32 season. During
      those contract negotiations, the 10 FBS commissioners and Notre Dame
      athletic director Pete Bevacqua signed a memorandum of understanding that
      granted the Big Ten and SEC "the bulk of control over the playoff's future
      format," according to multiple reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      This memorandum of understanding represented a dramatic shift from the
      previous governance structure where all Power Conferences held equal
      voting power. SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey acknowledged the new power
      arrangement publicly at SEC Media Days in July 2025, stating that the
      document "very clearly grants" decision-making authority to the
      combination of the SEC and Big Ten, adding that "ultimately we have to use
      that authority with great wisdom and discretion." Under the new structure,
      changes to the future playoff format no longer require approval from the
      CFP's board of managers, which is composed of university presidents and
      chancellors. Instead, the commissioners and Notre Dame's athletic director
      make these decisions, with the SEC and Big Ten effectively holding veto
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This governance restructuring reflected brutal economic reality. The SEC
      and Big Ten controlled the majority of college football's television
      viewership, recruiting talent, and revenue generation. FOX Sports
      estimated that the new CFP deal would generate $20-22 million per school
      annually, with the SEC and Big Ten demanding 58% of playoff revenue
      starting in 2026. Television networks were primarily paying for SEC and
      Big Ten content, with other conferences providing supplementary
      programming. During spring 2024 CFP negotiations, the two mega-conferences
      threatened to break away and create their own playoff if they didn't
      receive majority control and revenue share.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other eight FBS conferences and Notre Dame acquiesced to these
      demands, essentially "handing over control," as multiple sources described
      it. The memorandum of understanding only covers a 12- or 14-team playoff
      format, meaning any expansion to 16, 24, or more teams would require both
      the SEC and Big Ten to agree on new terms. This created a situation where
      both mega-conferences needed to consent for any significant changes to
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The timing of this power shift proved catastrophic for reaching consensus
      on future expansion. By requiring both the SEC and Big Ten to agree, the
      CFP contract made it nearly impossible to implement any playoff format
      they didn't both enthusiastically support. And as would become clear
      through 2024 and 2025, the two conferences had very different ideas about
      what the playoff should look like, even as they agreed that 12 teams
      wasn't enough. The governance structure that was supposed to prevent the
      SEC and Big Ten from being outvoted by smaller conferences instead created
      a situation where the two mega-conferences could deadlock each other,
      bringing playoff expansion to a complete standstill.
    </p>
    <h2>SEC-Big Ten Alliance</h2>
    <p>
      On February 9, 2024, the SEC and Big Ten announced a groundbreaking
      alliance that would reshape college athletics. The joint announcement from
      SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey and Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti
      described an "historic partnership" focused on "student-athlete welfare,"
      "competitive excellence," and "the future of college sports." The two
      conferences, representing 34 of the most powerful athletic programs in the
      nation, committed to working together on scheduling, playoff format
      discussions, and media rights negotiations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stated goals of the alliance sounded noble. Both conferences
      emphasized their commitment to maintaining academic standards for
      student-athletes, ensuring appropriate rest periods between games, and
      preserving the traditions that made college football special. They spoke
      about creating opportunities for intersectional play, with potential
      regular-season games between SEC and Big Ten opponents becoming marquee
      events. They promised to collaborate on playoff expansion discussions to
      ensure a fair and competitive postseason format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reality was far more calculated. The SEC-Big Ten Alliance was
      fundamentally about power consolidation and revenue maximization. With 34
      schools between them, the two conferences controlled nearly 30% of all FBS
      programs but commanded far more than 30% of television viewership,
      recruiting rankings, and athletic department revenues. By joining forces,
      they could effectively dictate terms to the CFP, media partners, bowl
      games, and other conferences. They didn't need to break away from the NCAA
      or FBS structure if they could simply control it from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alliance created immediate strategic advantages. In media rights
      negotiations, the two conferences could present a unified front, ensuring
      maximum payouts from networks desperate for their content. In playoff
      discussions, they could jointly advocate for formats that guaranteed
      multiple bids for each conference while limiting access for smaller
      conferences. In scheduling, they could coordinate to avoid cannibalizing
      each other's strength of schedule arguments while scheduling enough
      intersectional games to boost both conferences' overall profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, cracks in the alliance appeared almost immediately. The SEC and
      Big Ten might share common interests in dominating college football, but
      they remained fierce competitors for recruits, coaches, television
      ratings, and playoff spots. Every SEC team in the playoff meant one fewer
      Big Ten team, and vice versa. Every five-star recruit who chose Alabama
      was a recruit who didn't choose Ohio State. The conferences might
      cooperate when facing external challenges, but they would compete
      ruthlessly when dividing the spoils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alliance also faced philosophical differences that proved difficult to
      bridge. The Big Ten prided itself on academic standards and research
      university partnerships, with many members belonging to the prestigious
      Association of American Universities. The SEC embraced a football-first
      mentality where winning championships took priority over almost everything
      else. The Big Ten valued traditional bowl affiliations, particularly the
      Rose Bowl's tie to the conference champion. The SEC was more willing to
      abandon tradition if it meant more money or playoff access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geographic and cultural differences added to the tension. Big Ten schools
      stretched from Rutgers in New Jersey to USC in Los Angeles, creating
      travel nightmares and time zone complications. The SEC remained more
      regionally concentrated, which simplified logistics but potentially
      limited their national media appeal. Big Ten athletic directors worried
      about student-athletes missing excessive class time for cross-country
      travel. SEC athletic directors worried their teams might be disadvantaged
      in recruiting against Big Ten schools offering closer-to-home
      opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      By mid-2024, the alliance had become more symbolic than substantive. The
      conferences continued to coordinate on certain issues, particularly when
      negotiating with the CFP or NCAA, but the promised regular-season
      scheduling agreements never materialized in meaningful numbers. Joint
      initiatives on student-athlete welfare produced few concrete changes. Most
      tellingly, the two conferences began proposing different solutions to the
      playoff expansion impasse, each prioritizing their own interests over
      alliance unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SEC-Big Ten Alliance ultimately represented a marriage of convenience
      rather than a genuine partnership. Both conferences recognized they were
      stronger together than apart when facing external pressures, but neither
      was willing to subordinate its own goals to alliance harmony. The alliance
      would hold as long as it served both parties' interests, but would
      fracture the moment those interests diverged significantly. And when it
      came to playoff expansion, those interests diverged dramatically.
    </p>
    <h2>SEC and Big Ten Propose Different Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      As playoff expansion negotiations dragged through 2024 and into 2025, the
      fundamental incompatibility between SEC and Big Ten interests became
      impossible to ignore. Both conferences wanted more playoff spots for their
      teams, but they disagreed sharply on how to structure a system that would
      maximize their respective advantages. What emerged was a complex dance of
      competing proposals that shifted dramatically over time, exposing deep
      philosophical rifts between the two mega-conferences.
    </p>
    <h3>The Initial Push: 14-Team Playoff with 3-3-2-2-1 Format</h3>
    <p>
      The first serious expansion proposal surfaced in February 2024, when CFP
      officials began discussing a 14-team format. According to multiple
      reports, the SEC and Big Ten initially proposed a model giving each
      conference four automatic bids, which would have left only one at-large
      spot in a 14-team field. This "egregious" proposal, as one college
      administrator described it, faced immediate pushback from the ACC, Big 12,
      and other conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal quickly evolved into what became known as the "3-3-2-2-1"
      format: three automatic bids each for the SEC and Big Ten, two each for
      the ACC and Big 12, one for the highest-ranked Group of Five champion, and
      three at-large selections. Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported that
      this format was "being socialized among major conference administrators"
      as a compromise to the original four-bid proposal. However, even this
      scaled-back version faced skepticism from conferences that would receive
      only two guaranteed spots while the SEC and Big Ten secured three each.
    </p>
    <h3>The Big Ten's Evolution: The 4-4-2-2-1 Model and Beyond</h3>
    <p>
      By late 2024 and early 2025, the discussion shifted to a 16-team playoff,
      with the Big Ten leading the charge for what became known as the
      "4-4-2-2-1-3" format. This proposal would grant four automatic berths each
      to the Big Ten and SEC, two each to the ACC and Big 12, one to the
      highest-ranked Group of Five conference champion, and three at-large bids
      (with potential protection for Notre Dame). Big Ten Commissioner Tony
      Petitti championed this approach at Big Ten media days in July 2025,
      emphasizing "a playoff system that allocates spots based on conference
      standings and the results of playing games."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Ten's rationale centered on reducing reliance on what they
      perceived as an inconsistent selection committee. "Make it about how you
      compete against your conference and take out any sort of perceived bias or
      politicking and campaigning," one Big Ten source explained. The format
      would also enable season-ending conference championship play-in games,
      where the Big Ten could pit their third, fourth, fifth, and sixth-placed
      teams against each other in on-campus matchups during conference
      championship weekend, creating additional high-stakes inventory for
      television partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Ten later evolved this thinking even further. By November 2025,
      Big Ten athletic directors were socializing a 24-team concept dubbed
      "4-4-4-4-2-6"—four automatic bids for each Power Four conference, two for
      the Group of Five/Six, and six at-large selections. This massive
      expansion, similar to the FCS playoff format, would address ACC and Big 12
      concerns about equal treatment while creating enormous television
      inventory. FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks publicly supported this direction,
      stating "I'm very much in favor of expanding the CFP. I don't see any
      reason why the CFP can't be 24 teams."
    </p>
    <h3>The SEC's Stunning Pivot: From 4-4-2-2-1 to 5+11</h3>
    <p>
      Initially, many SEC athletic directors supported the Big Ten's 4-4-2-2-1
      model. The format would guarantee the SEC four playoff spots annually,
      with potential for a fifth through at-large selection. It also created
      opportunities for lucrative play-in games and reduced dependence on a
      selection committee that SEC officials viewed with growing skepticism
      after the 2024 playoff selections included four Big Ten teams but only
      three SEC teams despite the SEC's perceived superior strength of schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, at the SEC's May 2025 spring meetings in Destin, Florida, the
      conference's powerful head coaches staged what amounted to a revolt
      against the 4-4-2-2-1 format. The 16 SEC coaches strongly preferred a
      different approach: a "5+11" model with five automatic bids for conference
      champions and 11 at-large selections—essentially an expanded version of
      the current 12-team format's philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coaches' objections were practical and strategic. Brian Kelly, former
      LSU Head Coach, articulated the core concern: "Take the top 12-14-16
      teams. That's my personal opinion. We'd much rather have a situation where
      more of our teams could get in than limiting it with AQs." The coaches
      worried that teams participating in play-in games and advancing to the
      national championship would play 18 total games, creating player safety
      and academic concerns. More fundamentally, data presented at the meetings
      showed the SEC might actually place more teams in a 5+11 format than in a
      4-4-2-2-1 format, since SEC depth would dominate at-large selections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgia's Kirby Smart and Ole Miss's Lane Kiffin (now at LSU) became vocal advocates
      for reforming the selection committee's criteria rather than creating
      automatic qualifier systems. Smart noted that "there's no outcry saying
      it's unfair when the SEC gets 13 of 16 teams in the (NCAA) basketball
      tournament by using RPI," arguing that a metrics-based approach to
      selecting the best 16 teams would favor the SEC more than guaranteed
      spots. Kiffin went further, suggesting the playoff should "take the 16
      best teams" and eliminate automatic bids altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey listened to his coaches and publicly
      acknowledged the shift. "They talked about—I'll call it a 5+11 model—and
      our own ability to earn those berths," Sankey said at the conclusion of
      the spring meetings. "At the coaching level, the question is, why wouldn't
      that be fine? Why wouldn't we do that?" By the end of May 2025, the SEC
      appeared to be moving away from the 4-4-2-2-1 format it had previously
      supported, creating a potential rift with the Big Ten just months after
      their alliance was formed.
    </p>
    <h3>The Core Philosophical Divide</h3>
    <p>
      The fundamental disagreement between the Big Ten and SEC after May 2025
      reflected incompatible philosophies about what a playoff should
      accomplish. The Big Ten wanted structure and predictability through
      automatic qualifiers, believing this would "take away power from a
      perceived inconsistent selection committee process and allow for better
      non-conference scheduling," according to sources familiar with the
      discussions. Conferences would control their own destinies through
      conference standings rather than depending on committee judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SEC, influenced heavily by its coaches, wanted the opposite: maximum
      flexibility for the selection committee to choose what they believed were
      genuinely the best teams, even if that meant taking five or six SEC teams
      and leaving out conference champions from weaker leagues. The SEC viewed
      automatic bids as welfare for inferior conferences, guaranteeing spots to
      teams that had no realistic chance of winning a national championship
      while potentially excluding elite SEC teams that had simply cannibalized
      each other during the regular season.
    </p>
    <p>
      These competing visions created irreconcilable problems. The Big Ten's
      4-4-2-2-1 model explicitly rejected the SEC's premise that merit alone
      should determine playoff access. The SEC's preferred 5+11 model explicitly
      rejected the Big Ten's desire to minimize committee influence. Neither
      conference was willing to subordinate its core principles to reach
      agreement, and neither needed to—both held veto power over any format
      change through the 2024 memorandum of understanding.
    </p>
    <h3>The Alliance Fractures</h3>
    <p>
      The SEC's May 2025 pivot to supporting the 5+11 format caught Big Ten
      officials completely off guard and effectively ended any pretense of
      SEC-Big Ten unity on playoff matters. According to Yahoo Sports, the Big
      Ten had "voiced private displeasure over moving to 5+11 if the SEC sticks
      to eight conference games," creating yet another point of contention. The
      Big Ten wanted the SEC to expand to nine conference games if they were
      going to embrace at-large heavy formats, believing eight-game SEC
      schedules provided an unfair advantage in win-loss records compared to
      nine-game Big Ten schedules. In August 2025, the SEC has officially
      implemented a nine-game conference football schedule beginning in 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
      More fundamentally, the SEC's reversal revealed that the alliance had
      always been tactical rather than strategic. When it served both
      conferences' interests to present a united front against smaller
      conferences, they cooperated. But when their interests diverged on the
      actual structure of playoff expansion, cooperation evaporated immediately.
      The SEC prioritized its coaches' preferences and its own data analysis
      over maintaining Big Ten partnership, while the Big Ten refused to
      compromise on automatic qualifier structures that the SEC now opposed.
    </p>
    <h3>The Remaining Conferences' Dilemma</h3>
    <p>
      While the SEC and Big Ten battled over competing visions, the remaining
      conferences found themselves in an impossible position. The ACC and Big
      12, represented by commissioners Jim Phillips and Brett Yormark
      respectively, became vocal opponents of the 4-4-2-2-1 format. "No one
      likes it," one ACC athletic director told Yahoo Sports after being briefed
      on the proposal at ACC spring meetings. ACC coaches recommended that their
      conference push for at least three automatic qualifiers rather than accept
      second-class status with only two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ironically, the ACC and Big 12 found themselves supporting the same 5+11
      format that SEC coaches preferred, though for different reasons. The
      smaller power conferences saw 5+11 as preserving their access through
      guaranteed conference champion bids while relying on at-large selections
      to reward strong teams regardless of conference affiliation. Big 12
      Commissioner Brett Yormark told The Athletic he welcomed the formula
      "because we've got to earn it on the field. I tell my room, you're
      rewarded when you perform at the highest levels." Utah athletic director
      Mark Harlan echoed this sentiment: "I think the public and we agree that
      you have to win this thing on the field…Then Big 12, let's win more games.
      Let's get after it."
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the alignment between the SEC coaches and the ACC/Big 12 on 5+11
      didn't represent true alliance so much as parallel interests. The SEC
      believed it would dominate at-large selections under any committee-based
      model, potentially placing five or six teams. The ACC and Big 12 simply
      wanted to preserve their conference champions' automatic access. Both
      could support 5+11, but they supported it for entirely different strategic
      reasons—reasons that might diverge dramatically once the selection
      committee actually started making decisions under the new format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The non-power FBS conferences (American, Mountain West, MAC, CUSA, Sun
      Belt) and the rebuilt Pac-12 had even less leverage. Any format being
      seriously discussed guaranteed them at most one or two collective
      automatic bids, meaning at least four of the six conferences would have
      their champions excluded annually. These conferences couldn't effectively
      advocate for their interests because they lacked the economic power to
      threaten the negotiations, and they couldn't form a unified coalition
      because their interests were fundamentally competitive—each wanted to be
      the Group of Five conference that received the automatic bid.
    </p>
    <h3>Continued Stalemate</h3>
    <p>
      The CFP set a December 1, 2025 deadline to inform ESPN of any format
      changes for the 2026 season. The deadline was extended to January 23,
      2026. As that deadline approached, the impasse only deepened. Mississippi
      State president and CFP Board of Managers chair Mark Keenum told the SEC
      Network in late November: "We have to make a decision before the end of
      this month if we're going to expand to 16 next year. I'll be honest, I'm
      not very optimistic that we'll get to that, but we'll keep working on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The obstacles to agreement proved insurmountable in the available
      timeframe. The Big Ten insisted on automatic qualifier structures that the
      SEC coaches had rejected. The SEC wanted committee process reforms that
      the Big Ten believed would enable bias and politicking. The ACC and Big 12
      refused to accept formats that gave them fewer guaranteed spots than the
      mega-conferences. The non-power FBS Conferences threatened legal action if
      excluded entirely. Notre Dame demanded protection for its independent
      status. No proposal could satisfy even half of these competing demands
      simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deadline passed with no agreement. The 12-team playoff format would
      remain in place for 2026, not because anyone believed it was adequate, but
      because the alternative was chaos. The SEC and Big Ten, who controlled the
      format through their memorandum of understanding, had achieved perfect
      gridlock—each could block the other's preferred solution, but neither
      could advance their own. The alliance that was supposed to consolidate
      their power had instead paralyzed college football's postseason.
    </p>
    <h2>Why My 32-Team Playoff Solution Works Best</h2>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff format solves the zero-sum dynamics that have plagued
      every previous system and ended negotiations in stalemate. Rather than
      forcing conferences to fight over a limited number of spots, it creates
      enough room for everyone while still rewarding competitive excellence.
      Most importantly, it addresses the core concerns of both mega-conferences
      while preserving access for all of FBS.
    </p>
    <h3>Eliminating Zero-Sum Competition</h3>
    <p>
      The fundamental problem with 4-team and 12-team playoffs, and even the
      proposed 16-team formats, is that they create artificial scarcity. When
      only 12 or 16 teams can participate, every spot given to one conference is
      a spot denied to another. This makes cooperation impossible because
      conferences are negotiating over a fixed pie where one side's gain is
      necessarily another side's loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      A 32-team playoff eliminates this dynamic entirely. With 10 automatic bids
      for all conference champions and 22 at-large selections, there is room for
      the SEC to place 6-8 teams, the Big Ten to place 6-8 teams, AND every
      conference champion to receive an automatic bid. The SEC gets rewarded for
      their depth. The Big Ten gets rewarded for their strength. Smaller
      conferences get their champions in. Everyone wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This abundance of spots doesn't mean the playoff lacks competitiveness.
      The seeding structure ensures that regular-season excellence matters
      enormously. The top 16 seeds receive home games in the first round, and
      the top 8 seeds are guaranteed home games through the second round if they
      win. A team that goes 12-0 in the SEC isn't treated the same as a team
      that goes 10-2 in the Sun Belt, even though both make the playoff.
      Performance determines seeding, and seeding determines path to the
      championship.
    </p>

    <h3>Addressing SEC Concerns About Depth and Merit</h3>
    <p>
      The SEC's primary objection to previous proposals has been that they don't
      adequately reward conference depth and strength of schedule. A 32-team
      playoff addresses this directly by providing enough at-large bids to
      accommodate deserving teams from strong conferences. If the SEC has 7
      teams ranked in the top 25, all seven can make the playoff. If the Big Ten
      has 6 teams that deserve consideration, all six can earn bids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeding structure also ensures that SEC excellence is rewarded
      tangibly. An undefeated SEC team will almost certainly earn a top-4 seed,
      guaranteeing two home games and an easier path through the bracket. An
      11-1 SEC team that dominated its schedule will likely earn a top-16 seed
      with at least one home game. Even a 9-3 SEC team that lost to three ranked
      opponents might earn an at-large bid as an unseeded team or have a slim chance at a top 16 seed, giving them a
      chance to prove themselves in the playoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revenue distribution model addresses SEC financial concerns by scaling
      payouts with advancement. First-round participation earns $7M, but making
      the national championship game earns a cumulative $60M for conference
      members. This creates enormous financial incentives for regular-season
      excellence because better seeding leads to easier paths, more wins, and
      exponentially higher revenue. The SEC's depth would translate directly to
      conference wealth as multiple teams advance deep into the playoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, the 32-team format lets the SEC prove its claims about
      competitive superiority on the field. If the SEC truly believes their
      5th-best team would beat most conference champions, they can demonstrate
      it in playoff games rather than argue about it in committee meetings.
      Head-to-head competition settles debates that ranking systems never can.
    </p>

    <h3>Addressing Big Ten Concerns About Access and Tradition</h3>
    <p>
      The Big Ten's emphasis on guaranteed access for conference champions is
      fully accommodated in a 32-team format. All 10 FBS conference champions
      receive automatic bids, ensuring that winning your conference always means
      something. This preserves the importance of the regular season and
      conference races while still allowing at-large bids for deserving teams
      that don't win their conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The format also preserves and enhances traditional bowl games by using the
      New Year's Six bowls for quarterfinal and semifinal games. The Rose Bowl
      can maintain its New Year's Day prominence by hosting a semifinal game
      annually, preserving its tradition while integrating it into the playoff
      structure. The Sugar, Orange, Cotton, Peach, and Fiesta Bowls rotate
      hosting duties for the remaining quarterfinal and semifinal games,
      ensuring all maintain relevance and revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geographic concerns about travel are addressed through the campus site
      structure for early rounds. The first two rounds occur at the higher seeds' home stadiums. This minimizes travel as best as possible and creates incredible home-field atmospheres that enhance the playoff experience. Only the final 8 teams face neutral-site bowl games, at a point in the season when extended travel is more manageable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Ten's concerns about competitive balance and long-term
      sustainability are addressed by ensuring all conferences maintain pathways
      to the playoff. This prevents the concentration of talent and resources
      into just two mega-conferences, which would eventually make the sport less
      interesting even for SEC and Big Ten fans. Upsets and Cinderella stories
      keep college football compelling, and a 32-team format creates more
      opportunities for them.
    </p>

    <h3>Preserving Competitive Balance Across FBS</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bid structure for all 10 conference champions ensures that
      every FBS conference maintains a stake in the playoff structure. This
      prevents the catastrophic scenario where the SEC and Big Ten break away
      from the rest of FBS, fragmenting the sport and destroying decades of
      tradition and regional rivalries. As long as every conference has a
      pathway to the national championship, there's a reason to maintain FBS
      unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This structure also preserves recruiting balance to some degree. High
      school players who want to compete for championships can look at schools
      across all conferences, knowing that an undefeated season at Boise State
      or Memphis provides a path to the playoff just as surely as a season at
      Georgia or Michigan. While the SEC and Big Ten will always have recruiting
      advantages, a 32-team playoff prevents them from monopolizing championship
      opportunities entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeding structure maintains appropriate competitive hierarchy while
      allowing for upsets. A 12-0 Mountain West champion might make the playoff
      as a top 16 seed. This would allow them to host at least one playoff game against an unseeded team. While there are those
      that don't like Cinderella stories to happen in College Football, we
      already had a Cinderella story in 2021. American Conference Champion
      Cincinnati made the 4-team playoff in 2021, becoming the first non-power
      FBS conference champion to make the playoffs.
    </p>
    <h3>Economic Incentive Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      The revenue model creates powerful incentives that align everyone's
      interests toward making the playoff succeed. Conferences earn money based
      on their teams' advancement, incentivizing them to schedule challenging
      non-conference games that prepare teams for playoff competition. Schools
      earn hosting revenue from first and second-round home games, making
      regular-season excellence directly profitable. Bowl games maintain
      relevance by hosting quarterfinals and semifinals, ensuring their economic
      survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scale of potential revenue also makes the format economically
      compelling for everyone. The total playoff distribution could exceed $550M
      annually, dwarfing the current CFP payouts. Television networks would pay
      premium rates for 31 playoff games spanning five rounds, including
      multiple games in prime holiday time slots. Ticket sales from campus-site
      games would directly benefit host schools rather than neutral-site bowls,
      creating new revenue streams for successful programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, the revenue structure discourages breakaway scenarios.
      If the SEC and Big Ten tried to form their own playoff system excluding
      other conferences, they'd be walking away from hundreds of millions in
      potential revenue that comes from the excitement of cross-conference
      matchups and underdog stories. A 32-team playoff makes staying together
      more profitable than breaking apart, which is the only sustainable
      long-term solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Ending the Impasse Through Abundance</h3>
    <p>
      The negotiations have failed repeatedly because every proposal forces
      someone to lose. The SEC's preferred 5+11 format with minimal automatic
      bids leaves conference champions vulnerable to committee decisions. The
      Big Ten's 4-4-2-2-1 format with tiered automatic qualifiers creates a
      permanent hierarchy that smaller conferences can never escape. Every
      compromise proposal splits the difference but satisfies no one because the
      fundamental problem is scarcity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A 32-team playoff doesn't require anyone to compromise their core values.
      The SEC doesn't have to accept weak conference champions taking spots from
      strong at-large teams because there are enough spots for both. The Big Ten
      doesn't have to sacrifice automatic access for conference champions
      because all champions get in. Smaller conferences don't have to accept
      second-class status because their champions receive the same automatic bid
      as SEC and Big Ten champions, even if seeding reflects strength of
      schedule differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This abundance creates a pathway to agreement that has eluded every other
      format. Conference commissioners can return to their schools and honestly
      say "we got what we needed." The SEC can claim victory by securing enough
      at-large bids to reward their depth—potentially placing 6-7 teams in a
      given year. The Big Ten can claim victory by preserving automatic access
      for all conference champions and maintaining bowl traditions. The ACC and
      Big 12 can claim victory by ensuring their champions always have a path.
      Smaller conferences can claim victory by maintaining their pathway to the
      national championship. Everyone wins because the pie is big enough for
      everyone to get an adequate slice.
    </p>

    <h3>Practical Implementation Advantages</h3>
    <p>
      The 32-team format also offers practical advantages that smaller playoffs
      can't match. Scheduling 31 games across five rounds is logistically
      complex but manageable, especially with the first two rounds on campus
      sites requiring minimal coordination. The quarterfinal and semifinal bowl
      games already have the infrastructure to host playoff games. The national
      championship game can use the same neutral-site rotation as the current
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Academic coordination during December playoffs has proven precedent across all NCAA football divisions.</b> Division I FCS has successfully managed a 24-team playoff field that runs through Thanksgiving Weekend and into January, with December postseason games occurring during finals week. Division II (32 teams since 2025) and Division III (40 teams) also navigate December playoffs alongside academic schedules. As the level directly below FBS, FCS provides the most relevant precedent: demonstrating that with proper coordination between universities, professors, and student-athletes, December playoff games are entirely manageable alongside academic commitments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key accommodations that make this work include:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Exam rescheduling coordination:</b> Student-athletes work with the registrar's office and professors to take finals before travel or during alternative time slots</li>
        <li><b>Flexible practice schedules:</b> Morning or evening practices allow dedicated study time during finals week</li>
        <li><b>Institutional support:</b> Registrar offices and professors accommodate exam scheduling conflicts for student-athletes participating in playoff games</li>
        <li><b>Limited disruption window:</b> Only teams advancing deep in the playoffs miss significant class time in January—most teams complete their seasons during winter break</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For detailed coordination protocols, see <a href="/modern-landscape/off-the-field.html">Off the Field considerations</a>. The FCS model proves this system works - FBS simply needs to adopt similar policies at scale.</p>
      <p>
        The format also builds naturally on the 12-team playoff infrastructure that already exists. The selection committee already ranks the top 25 teams; expanding to rank the top 32 is incremental. The technology for broadcasting and managing the playoff is already proven. The financial structures for distributing revenue are already established. We're not building from scratch; we're scaling up an existing successful model.
      </p>
      <h3>The Only Sustainable Path Forward</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the 32-team playoff works because it's the only format that gives everyone enough of what they need to live with what they don't get.  The SEC and Big Ten get to place multiple teams and earn massive revenue.  Smaller conferences get guaranteed access and respect. Traditional bowl games survive and thrive. Media partners get premium inventory. Fans get more meaningful games and clearer championship pathways. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        Compare this to the alternatives. Maintaining the 12-team playoff leaves
      everyone frustrated with artificial cutoffs and controversial selections.
      The Big Ten's 4-4-2-2-1 proposal creates a permanent caste system that
      would accelerate conference realignment chaos as schools desperately try
      to join the SEC or Big Ten. The SEC's 5+11 proposal leaves too much power
      with a selection committee that both conferences have criticized as
      inconsistent and biased. A 24-team playoff addresses some access issues
      but uses the awkward 4-4-4-4-2-6 structure that still creates tiers among
      conferences and doesn't fully resolve the zero-sum competition. While the
      ACC and Big 12 would get the same automatic bids as the SEC and Big Ten,
      factoring in the at-large bids, they, along with the non-power FBS
      conferences would still get fewer guaranteed spots than the SEC and Big
      Ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most ominously, the current stalemate raises the specter of an SEC-Big Ten
      breakaway. If these two conferences can't agree on a format with the other
      eight FBS conferences, they might eventually conclude that breaking away
      is simpler than negotiating. Such a breakaway would be catastrophic for
      college football—destroying traditional rivalries, fragmenting the sport's
      fanbase, creating antitrust issues, and transforming college football into
      a closed professional league that abandons everything that makes it
      unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff prevents this nightmare scenario by making unity more
      valuable than separation. The format is large enough to accommodate
      everyone's legitimate interests, structured enough to maintain competitive
      integrity, and lucrative enough to discourage breakaway schemes. It
      respects the SEC and Big Ten's dominance while preserving pathways for
      every conference. It balances tradition with innovation, access with
      merit, and stability with competitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis hovering over college football isn't really about playoff
      formats or automatic bids. It's about whether the sport can maintain its
      unity in the face of massive power imbalances. Can college football
      survive as one sport when two conferences control most of the money,
      talent, and influence? Can we create a system that acknowledges this
      reality while preventing it from destroying everything else?
    </p>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff answers yes to both questions. It provides a framework
      for unity that acknowledges power imbalances while preventing them from
      fracturing the sport. It creates enough room for the powerful to dominate
      without forcing everyone else into irrelevance. It's not a perfect
      solution for anyone, but it's a good enough solution for everyone—which is
      the only type of solution that can actually be implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten control college football's future through their 2024
      memorandum of understanding. They can continue deadlocking each other over
      competing visions that satisfy neither, watch college football spiral into
      chaos and potentially litigation, or they can recognize that the 32-team
      playoff offers both conferences everything they actually need while
      preserving the sport they claim to value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice is theirs. The 32-team playoff represents the only
      sustainable path forward.  It is the only format that can do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>End the Impasse</li>
        <li>Preserve FBS Unity</li>
        <li>Reward Excellence</li>
        <li>Provide Access</li>
        <li>Generate Revenue</li>
