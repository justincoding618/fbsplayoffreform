    <h1>Why 32 Teams?</h1>
    <div class="intro-box">
      <p>
        College football faces an existential crisis. The current 12-team
        playoff is already showing serious flaws after just two seasons. <b>On January 23, 2026, the SEC and Big Ten failed to reach an agreement on expansion. The playoff remains at 12 teams.</b> Power conferences are discussing breaking away. The sport is fracturing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A 32-team playoff isn't just a better format—it's the comprehensive
          solution that preserves FBS unity while solving every major problem
          facing college football.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This page provides an overview of why 32 teams is the right answer. Each
        section below links to a detailed analysis of that particular argument.
      </p>

    <h2>The Case for 32 Teams</h2>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3>1. NCAA Historical Precedent</h3>
      <p>
        Every NCAA football division has independently arrived at the same
        conclusion: divisions need playoff fields that provide 16-20% access.
        FCS, Division II, and Division III all followed similar evolutionary
        paths, expanding their playoffs as membership grew and conferences
        multiplied.
      </p>
      <p><b>Key Facts:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>FCS (129 teams): 24-team playoff = 18.6% access</li>
        <li>Division II (161 teams): 32-team playoff = 19.9% access</li>
        <li>Division III (241 teams): 40-team playoff = 16.6% access</li>
        <li>
          FBS (136 teams): 12-team playoff = <b>8.8% access</b> ←
          Worst in NCAA football
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b
          >The 8-team format lasted exactly ONE season in FCS before being
          recognized as inadequate.</b
        >
        Division II spent 52 years experimenting before getting it right in
        2025. Division III took 51 years to reach adequate access. FBS should
        learn from their experience.

    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3>2. SEC-Big Ten Impasse</h3>
      <p>
        The SEC and Big Ten are locked in a bitter dispute
        over playoff expansion. Despite forming an alliance in February 2024,
        they now disagree on virtually everything. <b>The SEC and Big Ten failed to reach an agreement, so the College Football Playoff remains at 12 teams for at least another season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This outcome proves exactly what this proposal has been warning about: <b>partial solutions lead to dysfunction and gridlock.</b> The two most powerful conferences in college football, given sole authority over playoff decisions, could not agree on a path forward.  The sport remains stuck with a format that both conferences acknowledge is inadequate, because neither's preferred alternative solves the fundamental problems. This is what happens when you optimize for one constituency rather than the entire ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Competing Proposals:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>SEC wants 16 teams:</b> 5 power autobids + 1 non-power
          FBS autobid + 11 at-large (which non-power FBS conference gets the
          bid?)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Big Ten wants 24 teams:</b> 4 autobids per power
          conference + 2 non-power FBS autobids + 6 at-large (creates bye
          problems)
        </li>
        <li><b>Neither solves the fundamental problem</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A 32-team playoff eliminates the zero-sum dynamics. The SEC gets
        sufficient at-large depth (22 spots). The Big Ten gets broad access. All
        10 conferences get guaranteed autobids. No one needs to break away.

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3>3. Why Other Formats Fail</h3>
      <p>
        Every alternative playoff format creates new problems while leaving old
        ones unsolved:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>8 Teams:</b> Too exclusive. History proves it's always a
        starting point, never a destination. Would exclude multiple conference
        champions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>12 Teams (Current):</b> Already showing flaws—conference
        championships become redundant, bye teams struggle (1-7 record in
        quarterfinals), teams 13-16 have legitimate grievances, access shrinking
        as FBS grows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>16 Teams:</b> Impossible math. Either exclude non-power FBS
        conferences (creating two-tier system) or give all 10 conferences
        autobids with only 6 at-large spots (insufficient for power conference
        depth).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>24 Teams:</b> Byes create massive competitive imbalance.
        The gap between seed 8 (bye) and seed 9 (no bye) becomes the new
        controversy. Bracket structure complications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Big Ten's Multiple Autobids:</b> Guaranteeing 4 bids per
        power conference undermines the concept of "conference champion" and
        removes meritocracy. Creates massive inequity (16 power autobids vs. 2
        non-power FBS autobids).

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3>4. The Autobid-to-At-Large Balance</h3>
      <p>
        Division III's experience provides a critical lesson:
        <b
          >when automatic bids consume too much of the playoff field, the system
          breaks.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2023, Division III had a 7:1 ratio of autobids to at-large (28
        autobids, 4 at-large). With 240+ teams competing for only 4 at-large
        spots, deserving teams were systematically excluded. They had to expand
        to 40 teams.
      </p>
      <p><b>Comparison of Ratios:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Division III (before expansion): 7:1 ratio → Crisis</li>
        <li>Division III (current): 2.3:1 ratio → Fixed</li>
        <li>Division II (current): 1:1 ratio → Balanced</li>
        <li>FBS 16-team format (all conferences): 1.67:1 ratio → Tight</li>
        <li><b>FBS 32-team format: 1:2.2 ratio → Optimal</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A 32-team FBS playoff would have the healthiest autobid-to-at-large
        ratio in NCAA football, providing both guaranteed access AND
        meritocratic selection.

    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3>5. Revenue Maximization</h3>
      <p>
        The 32-team playoff generates approximately $556 million in total
        payouts across five rounds, with performance-based distribution that
        rewards competitive success:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Round (16 games): $224M distributed</li>
        <li>Second Round (8 games): $144M distributed</li>
        <li>Quarterfinals (4 games): $96M distributed</li>
        <li>Semifinals (2 games): $56M distributed</li>
        <li>National Championship (1 game): $36M distributed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A team reaching the national championship game earns $60M for their
        conference. Conferences with multiple teams making deep runs accumulate
        substantial revenue. This creates financial incentives for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>non-conference scheduling (improves at-large chances)</li>
        <li>
          Competitive conference play (seeding determines home-field advantage)
        </li>
        <li>Conference-wide competitive depth (more teams = more revenue)</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3>6. Preserves Conference Championship Flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        One of the major flaws of the current 12-team format: conference
        championship games become redundant when both participants are already
        playoff-bound. In 2024 and 2025, the SEC and Big Ten champions and their
        respective runner-ups were making the playoff regardless of the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 32-team proposal solves this by
        <b>making conference championships optional:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For teams eliminating the conference championship game, the automatic
          bid goes to the
          <b>regular season conference champion</b> (tiebreakers
          applied as needed)
        </li>
        <li>
          Conferences can choose whether to hold conference championship games
          based on their own needs
        </li>
        <li>
          If held, the winner of the conference championship game would earn the
          automatic bid to the playoffs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some might keep them for TV revenue; other conferences might eliminate
          them
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This respects conference autonomy while removing the structural problem
        of meaningless championship games. Similar to how some Division II and
        Division III conferences hold championship games while others don't.

      <h3>7. Competitive Balance Through Seeding</h3>
      <p>
        The 32-team format rewards regular season performance without creating
        the massive imbalances that byes create:
      </p>
      <p><b>How Seeding Works:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Top 16 teams are seeded 1-16</li>
        <li>
          Teams 17-32 are unseeded (includes lower-ranked conference champions)
        </li>
        <li>Seeds 1-8 host two home games (first and second round)</li>
        <li>Seeds 9-16 host one home game (first round only)</li>
        <li>Unseeded teams must win on the road</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Why This Is Better Than Byes:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Everyone plays the same number of games to advance—no multiple week
          layoffs
        </li>
        <li>
          Home-field advantage is meaningful but doesn't create rhythm/rust
          problems
        </li>
        <li>
          The regular season matters tremendously (difference between seeds 1-8,
          9-16, and unseeded (17-32) is massive)
        </li>
        <li>No arbitrary cutoff between "bye teams" and "non-bye teams"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Current 12-team data shows bye teams struggling: 1-7 record in
        quarterfinals (excluding Indiana). The extended layoff may be causing
        issues.

      <h3>8. Prevents Power Conference Breakaway</h3>
      <p>
        The SEC is "in preliminary stages of considering a conference-only
        governance model." This isn't hypothetical—fragmentation is a real
        threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why would power conferences want to break away?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Feeling constrained by limited at-large opportunities in current
          format
        </li>
        <li>Belief their competitive depth isn't adequately rewarded</li>
        <li>
          Frustration with governance structure and inability to reach
          agreements
        </li>
        <li>Desire for greater control over revenue distribution</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How 32 teams removes the incentive:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          22 at-large bids means the SEC can realistically send 6-8 teams in
          best years
        </li>
        <li>Big Ten can do the same—both conferences get what they want</li>
        <li>Performance-based revenue rewards competitive depth</li>
        <li>All conferences maintain guaranteed access through autobids</li>
        <li>No structural reason to destroy the sport's unified framework</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The 32-team playoff is the only format that simultaneously satisfies
        power conference demands AND maintains FBS unity.

      <h3>9. The Regular Season Still Matters</h3>
      <p>
        A common objection: "Won't expanding to 32 teams make the regular season
        meaningless?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The opposite is true.</b> The regular season determines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Conference championships:</b> Winners get automatic bids
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>At-large selection:</b> 22 competitive spots based on
          committee rankings
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Seeding (1-16):</b> Determines who gets home-field
          advantage
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Top 8 vs. Top 16:</b> Difference between two home games
          and one
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Seeded vs. Unseeded:</b> Massive difference between seed
          16 (home game) and seed 17 (road game)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every game matters because seeding determines your path. The difference
        between seed 5 (two home games) and seed 17 (unseeded, on the road) is
        enormous. Teams will fight for every ranking position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare this to other sports: the NFL playoffs include 14 of 32 teams
        (43.75% access) and the regular season still matters intensely for
        seeding.

      <h3>10. Bowl Games Are Preserved, Not Eliminated</h3>
      <p>A common concern: "Won't a 32-team playoff kill the bowl system?"</p>
      <p>
        <b>The opposite is true.</b> The 32-team format actually
        strengthens the bowl ecosystem by giving bowls meaningful roles and
        providing postseason opportunities for teams outside the playoff.
      </p>
      <p><b>How Bowl Games Fit Into the System:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>New Year's Six Bowls Host Playoff Games:</b> The Rose
          Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Peach Bowl, and Fiesta
          Bowl host the quarterfinals and semifinals on a rotating basis,
          maintaining their prestige and tradition
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Low-Tier Playoff Systems:</b> Teams outside the main
          playoff can compete in tiered playoff systems for additional
          postseason recognition
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Traditional Bowl Slots Remain:</b> Teams that don't make
          the 32-team playoff nor the low-tier playoff system still have bowl
          opportunities
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>More Teams Get Postseason Experience:</b> With 136 FBS teams, 64 participate in playoff systems (32 CFP + 16 NPI + 16 CPC), 16 more play in traditional bowls, meaning <b>80 total teams get postseason opportunities</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Low-Tier Playoff Solutions:</b></p>
      <p>
        For teams that don't make the 32-team CFP, the proposal includes
        additional postseason structures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The National Playoff Invitational (NPI) would serve for teams not
          selected to the CFP. This playoff would have 7 bowl games hosting the
          final three rounds, followed by four consolation bowl games, totaling
          up to 11 bowl games.
        </li>
        <li>
          The College Playoff Crown (CPC) would serve for teams not selected to
          the CFP nor NPI. Like the NPI, the playoff would have 7 bowl games
          hosting the final three rounds, followed by four consolation bowl
          games, totaling up to 11 bowl games.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bowl partnerships that maintain traditional matchups and regional
          connections
        </li>
        <li>
          Player development opportunities for programs building toward CFP
          competitiveness
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      <p><b>Complete Postseason Structure:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>32 teams: College Football Playoff (national championship path)</li>
        <li>16 teams: National Playoff Invitational (NPI - second-tier playoff)</li>
        <li>16 teams: College Playoff Crown (CPC - third-tier playoff)</li>
        <li>16 teams: Traditional bowl games (8 bowls remaining)</li>
        <li><b>Total: 80 of 136 teams (58.8%) receive postseason opportunities</b></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This ensures that most bowl-eligible teams (6+ wins) have a postseason destination, whether in a playoff system or traditional bowl game.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This approach is similar to college basketball:</b> The
        NCAA Tournament is the premier championship, but the NIT, CBC, and CBI provide additional opportunities. Nobody
        argues basketball's postseason has "too many" teams—the tiered system
        works.

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>
      College football stands at a crossroads. The current 12-team format is
      already failing. The SEC and Big Ten cannot agree on what comes next. The
      sport faces potential fragmentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>We have 50+ years of NCAA precedent showing us what works:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>FCS learned that 8 teams was inadequate after one season</li>
      <li>
        Division II spent 52 years experimenting before landing on 32 teams in
        2025
      </li>
      <li>
        Division III took 51 years to reach adequate access, expanding to 40
        teams in 2024
      </li>
      <li>
        All divisions converged on 16-20% playoff access as the sustainable
        standard
      </li>

    <p>
      FBS has 136 teams and 10 conferences. Division II (161 teams, 16
      conferences) just proved that 32 teams works. The math isn't complicated:
      <b
        >10 autobids + 22 at-large = access, merit, revenue, and unity.</b
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>And the bowl system isn't destroyed—it's enhanced</b> with
      meaningful roles for NY6 bowls in the playoff and continued opportunities
      for teams outside the top 32.

    <p>The real question isn't "Why 32 teams?"<br/>
        <b
        >The question is: "Why would the largest and most prominent division in
        college football provide worse playoff access (8.8%) than Division II
        (19.9%) and Division III (16.6%)?"</b
