        My main solution is the following:
        <uL>
          <li>Implement the 32-team field</li>
          <li>Use the New Year's Six Bowl Games as Quarterfinal and Semifinal Games</li>
          <li>Utilize the Top 4 Non-New Year's Six Bowl Games as Consolation Games for 2nd Round Participants</li>
          <li>Add two 16-team secondary playoffs (the NPI and CPC), where each would have 11 bowl games involved</li>
        </uL>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you may ask what if we want to implement a 32-team field, but for differing solutions?  Let's take a look at the different possible solutions other than the main solution that can happen.

      <h2>32-Team Playoff + Consolation Bowl Games For All CFP Participants Only</h2>
      <p>
        If we only want to implement the 32-team playoff plus consolation bowl games for first round and second round participants, then we would have 12 consolation bowl games total.  If we were to move forward with this, here are the following bowl games that would accept eliminated playoff teams:
          <table>

          The total revenue for implementing consolation bowl games for first round and second round participants or second round participants only would be the following (excluding non-Notre Dame FBS Independents):
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Consolation Bowl Games</th>

        <p>
          <b>Timing:</b> Consolation bowl games for eliminated playoff participants would be played sometime after Christmas and before around New Year's Day. This maintains the traditional bowl season timeline while integrating playoff participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of postseason games would remain the same as only implementing the 32-team playoff without the consolation bowl games for eliminate first round and second round participants.  In this scenario, we would still be able to retain a high quality of the top 12 non-New Year’s Six Bowl Games (based on revenue distribution).  Basically, you’re still keeping the current quality of the bowl eligible teams while also maintaining the quality of the top non-New Year’s Six Bowl Games.  However, we would have to slightly reduce the payout for the consolation bowl games for second round participants.  Regardless, you would basically significantly reduce the problem of teams with losing records participating in bowl games (unless more bowl games are added).  However, you would still also have the chance of players deciding to sit out of the bowl games after being eliminated from the FBS playoffs. If the <a href="/supplements/secondary-playoffs.html">secondary playoff system</a> is not implemented, then this solution would do just fine.

      <p>
        The NPI and CPC would still implement consolation bowl games to teams eliminated in the first round.  The consolation Bowl Games would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NPI Consolation</th>
            <th>CPC Consolation</th>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        With the consolation bowl games administered by the CFP, by implementing the NPI and CPC, there would be 32 bowl games that would be involved in the playoff.  That would leave us with about no stand-alone bowl games that would take teams that neither made it to the CFP, NPI, nor CPC.  In total, it would look like the following:
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Total</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
              <th>Composition</th>
              <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>64</td>
              <td>136</td>
              <td>47.1%</td>
              <td>
                32 Teams to the FBS Playoffs <br/>
                16 Teams to the NPI <br/>
                16 Teams to the CPC
              </td>
              <td>83 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        By implementing the 32-team field solution as well as the CFP administering consolation bowl games and two low tier playoffs, although we would have 64 teams total that would participate in any of the playoffs, we would decrease the selection percentage to 47.1% because there would only be 16 more teams that would participate in bowl games.  However, after selecting those 64 teams with at least a 0.500 record, we would have 16 more bowl eligible teams that would be invited to play in bowl games.  While the quality of bowl games would be lessened in the NPI and CPC, we would not have to worry about teams with losing records participate in bowl games.
      </p>

        Basically, we have 31 FBS playoff games (including the six bowl games hosting two of the last three rounds), plus 12 consolation bowl games for first round and second round FBS playoff participants, 15 National Playoff Invitational Games (NPI) Games (including the 7 bowl games that would host the final three rounds), 15 College Playoff Crown (CPC) Games (including the 7 bowl games that would host the final three rounds), and eight consolation bowl games for the NPI and CPC.  In total, that gives us 83 postseason games to work with.

      <p>
        While the first three rounds of the NPI and CPC would still apply, here is how the low tier playoff championships would look if we try to work around them:

        The National Playoff Invitational and the College Playoff Crown will take turns getting first pick of the dates of their Championship games.  For example, if the National Playoff Invitational gets first pick and New Year’s falls on a Friday, if they select Jan. 4 8PM as their kickoff date, then the College Playoff Crown would have the Jan. 5 8PM kickoff as their championship game date.  ESPN would still have exclusive rights to air the National Playoff Invitational championship, while FS1 and NBCSN would still alternate years to air the College Playoff Crown Championship.

        As you can see, with the 32-team playoff field administering 12 consolation bowl games, we see that the quality of the bowls for the NPI and CPC significantly decline, resulting in lower payouts for each of the secondary playoff rounds.

        The NPI and CPC would still implement consolation bowl games to teams eliminated in the first round.  The consolation Bowl Games would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NPI Consolation</th>
            <th>CPC Consolation</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        In total, by implementing the NPI and CPC, there would be 28 bowl games that would be involved in the playoff.  That would leave us with about 12 stand-alone bowl games that would take teams that neither made it to the CFP, NPI, nor CPC.  In total, it would look like the following:
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Total</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
              <th>Composition</th>
              <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>84</td>
              <td>136</td>
              <td>61.8%</td>
              <td>
                32 Teams to the FBS Playoffs <br/>
                16 Teams to the NPI <br/>
                16 Teams to the CPC <br/>
                20 Teams to Bowl Games
              </td>
              <td>79 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        By implementing the 32-team field solution as well as the two low tier playoffs plus consolation games, although we would have 64 teams total that would participate in any of the playoffs, there would be 28 more teams that would participate in bowl games.  However, after selecting those 64 teams with at least a 0.500 record, we would only be down to around 18 bowl eligible teams remaining.  That means that at least six more teams with losing records would be invited to play in bowl games.   
      </p>
      <p>
        How did we get to 80 postseason games?  Here is a further breakdown if you are curious:
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Postseason</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>CPC</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td>20 Teams</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, we have 31 FBS playoff games, 15 National Playoff Invitational Games (NPI) Games (including the 7 bowl games that would host the final three rounds), 15 College Playoff Crown (CPC) Games (including the 7 bowl games that would host the final three rounds), eight consolation bowl games for the NPI and CPC, and 11 more bowl games that are stand-alone to teams who do not make the 32-team field.  In total, this would still give us 80 postseason games to work with.   However, while the quality of bowl games would be great in the NPI and CPC, that would come at a cost of the quality of the remaining bowl eligible teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there are no consolation games for eliminated CFP participants and the first three rounds of the NPI and CPC would still apply, depending on which bowl games would kick off the NPI and CPC championship, here is how the low tier playoff championships would look if we try to work around them:
        <table>

      <p>
        The National Playoff Invitational and the College Playoff Crown will have around New Year’s Day or Eve to kick off their championship depending on the bowl game.  For example, if the Citrus Bowl hosts the National Playoff Invitational Championship, they would have the Jan 1 12PM ET kickoff (or Dec. 31 12PM ET kickoff if New Year’s Day falls on Sunday).  Then, the Duke’s Mayo Bowl hosting the College Playoff Crown would have the Dec. 31 7:30PM ET kickoff (or Dec. 29 7:30PM ET kickoff if New Year’s Day falls on Sunday to Tuesday).

      <h3>Noticing a Pattern</h3>
      <p>
        What we can get out of this is that the NPI and CPC and make a certain amount of revenue depending on the bowl games that are available.  You'll notice that when the CFP does not administer the consolation bowl games, the bowl lineup is the best with very good payouts to each team.  However, as we see when the CFP does administer consolation bowl games for first round and second round participants, the bowl quality goes down, meaning the payouts are not going to be very high.  If the CFP meets in the middle where they would take the top four non-New Year's Six Bowl Games (based on revenue) as consolation games for second round participants, we see that the bowl quality is still very good, and the payouts would meet in the middle of the two extreme ends.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        These scenarios provide alternative scenarios for implementing a 32-team field.  However, while these may be the right solution to some, they may not be the right solution to implement at certain times.  The reasons for introducing these altenative scenarios is for those who are curious if there are any alternatives.
