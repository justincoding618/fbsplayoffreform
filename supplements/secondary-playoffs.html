      <h1>Secondary Playoff System</h1>
      <p>
        In Division I Collegiate Athletics, four different sports administer secondary
        tier tournaments. Their purposes are to provide opportunities for teams
        who missed the NCAA championship tournaments. Men’s and women’s
        basketball, women’s volleyball, and softball were the sports that issue
        secondary tournaments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Administering secondary tournaments can work. Men’s and women’s basketball
        had success in fielding a secondary tournament. It was thanks to the NCAA
        that they made them happen. Triple Crown Sports was able to successfully
        revive the NIVC. The NIVC became a mainstay as a secondary tournament since
        its revival. However, we have to be wary of cases like the NISC. The NISC
        was a good idea on paper. However, it all came down to interest. Nearly no
        team was interested in participating in the NISC because they were not
        playing for a National Championship. It got to a point where the lack of
        interest could lead to the discontinuation of the NISC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Administering a secondary tier tournament comes down to interest as well as the
        potential revenue. Would there be enough interest for teams to play in a
        secondary tournament if they do not make it to the FBS playoffs? In
        addition, would there be enough potential revenue to administer secondary
        playoffs? Because of the bowl games involved, the answer may be a
        resounding no. However, in my opinion, there could be at least enough
        interest and potential revenue to administer a secondary playoff while
        having bowl games.
      </p>
      <h2>A New Unified Secondary Playoff System</h2>
      <div class="warning-box">
      <b
        >Note: Specific bowl game assignments throughout this proposal are illustrative and subject to change based on bowl game availability, sponsorship changes, and conference realignment. The structural framework of the playoff and secondary playoff systems remains valid regardless of which specific bowl games ultimately participate.</b
      >
      </div>
      <p>
        I would like to introduce my secondary playoff solution. The main secondary
        solution is going to be the National Playoff Invitational (NPI). The NPI
        would be similar to the current CFP. However, it would be a bit different.
        In addition to this, I am going to introduce another playoff to the secondary system
        called the College Playoff Crown (CPC). For each system, there would be
        four consolation bowl games for the eliminated first round participants
        and seven bowl games would rotate as quarterfinal, semifinal, and
        championship game. Four bowl games would rotate in a 4-year cycle to host
        the quarterfinals, semifinals and championship while two bowl games would
        rotate to host the semifinals, and one bowl game would function as a
        permanent quarterfinal game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NPI and CPC would re-purpose the bowl games to give them stakes, relevance, and guaranteed eyeballs that standalone bowl games increasingly can't attract. A bowl hosting an NPI quarterfinal, semifinal, or championship (or hosting a CPC quarterfinal, semifinal, or championship) has more value than a bowl hosting two 6-6 teams or a matchup of teams with losing records that nobody watches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we would be implementing consolation bowl games for eliminated second round FBS playoff participants only, the following would be the bowl games that would be involved in the NPI:

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        The NPI and CPC would still implement consolation bowl games to teams eliminated in the first round.  The consolation Bowl Games would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NPI Consolation</th>
            <th>CPC Consolation</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Birmingham Bowl</td>
            <td>New Mexico Bowl</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Armed Forces Bowl</td>
            <td>Boca Raton Bowl</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Hawaii Bowl</td>
            <td>First Responder Bowl</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Gasparilla Bowl</td>
            <td>New Orleans Bowl </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        In total, by implementing the NPI and CPC, there would be 32 bowl games that would be involved in either the primary 32-team playoff or the secondary playoff system.  That would leave us with about eight stand-alone bowl games that would take teams that neither made it to the CFP, NPI, nor CPC.  In total, it would look like the following:
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Total</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
              <th>Composition</th>
              <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>78</td>
              <td>136</td>
              <td>57.3%</td>
              <td>
                32 Teams to the FBS Playoffs <br/>
                16 Teams to the NPI <br/>
                16 Teams to the CPC <br/>
                14 Teams to Bowl Games
              </td>
              <td>80 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        By implementing the 32-team field solution as well as the secondary playoff system, although we would have 64 teams total that would participate in any of the playoffs, we would have a selection percentage to about 58.8% because there would be 16 more teams that would participate in bowl games.  After selecting those 64 teams with at least a 0.500 record, we would still have around 18 bowl eligible teams remaining.  However, with only 8 bowls remaining, there would only be room for 16 bowl eligible teams.   How did we get to 81 postseason games?  Here is a further breakdown if you are curious:
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Postseason</th>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>FBS Playoffs</td>
              <td>32 Teams</td>
              <td>31 Playoff Games + 4 Consolation Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>NPI</td>
              <td>16 Teams</td>
              <td>15 NPI Games + 4 Consolation Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>CPC</td>
              <td>16 Teams</td>
              <td>15 CPC Games + 4 Consolation Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bowl Games</td>
              <td>14 Teams</td>
              <td>7 Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Total</td>
              <td>78 Teams</td>
              <td>80 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, we have 31 FBS playoff games (including the six bowl games hosting two of the last three rounds), plus the top four non-New Year’s six bowl games as consolation games for second round FBS playoff participants, 15 National Playoff Invitational Games (NPI) Games (including the 7 bowl games that would host the final three rounds), 15 College Playoff Crown (CPC) Games (including the 7 bowl games that would host the final three rounds), eight consolation bowl games for the NPI and CPC, and eight more bowl games that are stand-alone to teams who do not make the 32-team field.  In total, that gives us 81 postseason games to work with.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The scenario where the CFP administers consolation bowl games for second round participants only works best because the quality of bowls in the NPI and CPC would still be great while maintaining the pool quality of remaining bowl eligible teams.  Although we would likely either leave out a few teams with 0.500 records or invite a few teams with losing records in the worst case scenario, this is likely the best balance of the three scenarios.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Introduce This Secondary Playoff System?</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to introduce the Secondary Playoff System for the following reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>Provides meaningful postseason for teams just outside the CFP</li>
          <li>Creates tiered championship opportunities (like basketball)</li>
          <li>Maintains bowl game viability and revenue</li>
          <li>Additional postseason opportunities for non-FBS power conferences</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        My proposed selection method for the 32-team field should resolve issues that would make the FBS championship playoff field unfair.  Putting the best teams in the 32-team field should be fair for all FBS conferences’ apprehensions about less postseason opportunities.  Introducing two Secondary Playoff System playoffs should further alleviate those apprehensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary 32-team playoff solution would have little to no impact on the implementation of the Secondary Playoff System.  The only impact of adding the Secondary Playoff System is providing more postseason opportunities for FBS teams.
      </p>
      <h2>Selection Process</h2>
      <p>
        The selection process for the NPI and CPC are going to be different.  Here is how each of them will happen.
      </p>
      <h3>NPI</h3>
      <p>
        The National Playoff Invitational (NPI) would operate similarly to the 2025 NIT.  The first four teams out of the main CFP would be the top four seeds in the NPI.  In addition, the next four out would be seeded 5-8.  The eight seeded teams would host the first round, while the final three rounds would happen at bowl sites.  Because all conference champions gain automatic bids to the playoff, the NPI would utilize the 5+11 format.  The top five rated conferences concluding the regular season would get one automatic bid each to the NPI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, five automatic bids would be distributed based on the top five rated conferences concluding the regular season.  The Conference Rank would be based on the average composite rankings of all the rankings from Massey Ratings.  The rest of the playoff field would be filled with at-large selections.
      </p>
      <h3>CPC</h3>
      <p>
        The College Playoff Crown (CPC), on the other hand, would have no automatic qualifiers.  They would accept teams that neither made the CFP nor the NPI.
      </p>
      <h2>Media Network Adjustments</h2>
      <p>
        With the introduction to the secondary playoff system, the proposed media networks for the 32-team field would stay the same.  The proposed media networks for the Secondary Playoff System would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Secondary Playoff</th>
            <th>TV Networks</th>
            <th>Streaming</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NPI</td>
            <td>ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU</td>
            <td>ESPN DTC</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>CPC</td>
            <td>FS!, NBCSN, The CW</td>
            <td>FOX One, Peacock</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h2>Kickoff Dates and Times</h2>
      <p>
        The kickoff times for the Secondary Playoff System would begin on the first weekend of December.  The first three rounds would run in December.  The first-round kickoff times of the Secondary Playoff System would look like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>First Round</th>

          </tr>
        </table>

      <p>
        The quarterfinal kickoff times of the Secondary Playoff System would look like the following:

      </p>
      <p>
        The semifinals would also happen in the bowl sites.  The kickoff times will depend on the FBS playoff quarterfinal schedule.   The kickoff times to the quarterfinal round has the option to do the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Game</th>

      <h3>Secondary Playoff Championships</h3>
      <p>
        Since there are consolation games for eliminated CFP second round participants, depending on which bowl games would kick off the NPI and CPC championship, here is how the Secondary Playoff Championships would look if we try to work around them:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NPI Championship</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date and Time (in ET)</th>
            <th>TV and Streaming</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Music City Bowl or Pop-Tarts Bowl</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 8PM ET or Dec. 29 8PM ET (if New Year’s falls on Monday or Tuesday)</td>
            <td rowspan="2">ESPN/ESPN DTC</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Texas Bowl or Sun Bowl</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 4PM ET or Dec. 29 4PM ET (if New Year’s falls on Monday or Tuesday)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>CPC Championship</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date and Time (in ET)</th>
            <th>TV and Streaming</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Pinstripe Bowl or Independence Bowl</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 4PM ET or Dec. 29 4PM ET (if New Year’s falls on Monday or Tuesday)</td>
            <td rowspan="2">FS1/FOX One OR NBCSN/Peacock</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Las Vegas Bowl or Military Bowl</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 8PM ET or Dec. 29 8PM ET (if New Year’s falls on Monday or Tuesday)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since New Year’s Day and Eve are now off limits, The National Playoff Invitational and the College Playoff Crown will alternate around the same date and times.  For example, if the Music City Bowl hosts the National Playoff Invitational Championship, they would have the Dec. 30 8PM ET kickoff (or Dec. 29 8PM ET kickoff if New Year’s Day falls on Monday or Tuesday).  Then, the Pinstripe Bowl hosting the College Playoff Crown would have the Dec. 30 4PM ET kickoff (or Dec. 29 4PM ET kickoff if New Year’s Day falls on Monday or Tuesday).  
      </p>

        We can utilize NPI and CPC as potential additional revenue for any highly ranked/seeded playoff participants alongside the 32-team field.  However, the payout would be a bit different than the current payouts of the College Football Playoff.  Since the CFP would enforce consolation bowl games for eliminated second round playoff participants, teams would receive the following payout for their success in the Secondary Playoff System:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Playoff Round</th>
            <th>FBS Conferences and Notre Dame</th>

            <td>$4.5M</td>
            <td>Share $2M</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NPI Consolation Bowl</td>
            <td>$5M</td>
            <td>Share $3M</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Quarterfinals</td>
            <td>$6M</td>
            <td>Share $4M</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Conferences, Notre Dame, and FBS Independents will get the following payout for each team making the CPC:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Playoff Round</th>
            <th>FBS Conferences and Notre Dame</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>$3M</td>
            <td>Share $1.5M</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>$3.5M</td>
            <td>Share $2.5M</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Quarterfinals</td>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note on FBS Independent Payouts:</b> Non-Notre Dame FBS Independents share the listed payout amount collectively. For example, if the payout is listed as "Share $3M," that $3M is divided among all non-Notre Dame independent schools participating in that round. Notre Dame, as a major independent program, receives the full FBS conference payout amount.

      <h2>Precedent for Multi-Tiered Postseason Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Some may express concern that a few bowl-eligible teams (6-6 or better) might not receive postseason opportunities under this system. However, multi-tiered postseason structures are normal across NCAA sports and don't diminish the value of championship access.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>College Basketball's Four-Tournament Model:</b> Men's basketball operates a successful multi-tiered postseason:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>NCAA Tournament:</b> 68 teams - the premier championship</li>
        <li><b>NIT (National Invitation Tournament):</b> 32 teams - historic secondary tournament</li>
        <li><b>CBC (College Basketball Crown):</b> 16 teams - competing as secondary tournament</li>
        <li><b>CBI (College Basketball Invitational):</b> 16 teams - third-tier opportunity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Combined, these four tournaments provide postseason opportunities for 132 of 362 Division I programs (36.5%). <b>Notably, the NIT, CBC, and CBI does invite teams with losing records to fill their fields, which means teams with winning records are sometimes excluded while teams with losing records participate.</b> Despite this, the multi-tiered system is widely considered successful—it provides meaningful championships at different levels without diluting the prestige of the NCAA Tournament.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Women's Volleyball Parallel:</b> The sport successfully operates both the NCAA Championship and the NIVC (National Invitational Volleyball Championship), providing tiered postseason opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>FBS Football Context:</b> The proposed system mirrors basketball's proven model but with stricter standards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>CFP (College Football Playoff):</b> 32 teams - premier championship</li>
        <li><b>NPI (National Playoff Invitational):</b> 16 teams - secondary playoff</li>
        <li><b>CPC (College Playoff Crown):</b> 16 teams - tertiary playoff</li>
        <li><b>Traditional Bowl Games:</b> 14 teams - standalone bowl games</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This provides postseason opportunities for 78 of 136 FBS teams (57.3%)—significantly more generous than basketball's 36.5%. <b>Critically, all three playoff tiers require at least a .500 record (6-6 or better), maintaining higher standards than basketball's secondary tournaments which accept teams with losing records.</b> Having a few bowl-eligible teams miss postseason play is not a flaw—it's a natural consequence of field size limitations that exists across all NCAA sports, and the proposed system maintains more rigorous eligibility standards than basketball's widely-accepted model.
      </p>
      <h2>The Downsides</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest downside to implementing two second tier playoffs (or even one) is the potential of teams declining bids to participate.  If a team misses a said playoff, they could see the Secondary Playoff System as meaningless.  We’ve seen this happen in college basketball where teams declined bids to the NIT and College Basketball Crown.  The teams that decline didn’t see any incentive for them to participate.  In addition, those teams want to plan ahead of the transfer portal.  The transfer portal currently starts the day after New Year’s (or January 3 if New Year’s is on a Sunday) and go until January 16th.  In addition, the five-day window comes into play if a team’s final postseason game happens on or after January 12.  Ideally, the transfer portal would happen after the CFP National Championship Game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another big downside is the investments and potential lack of interest.  There needs to be enough interest from sponsors, TV Networks, teams, conferences, and more to administer Secondary Playoffs.  We’ve seen the National Invitational Softball Championship not do well due to the lack of interest from teams.  However, we have also saw how the NCAA and Triple Crown Sports have done well with operating secondary tournaments in basketball and volleyball.  As long as there is a lot of interest, running two secondary tournaments wouldn’t be a problem.
