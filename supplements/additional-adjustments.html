      <h1>Additional Adjustments</h1>
      <p>
        The regular season adjustments making room for up to a 14-game regular
        season schedule with the elimination of conference championship games
        would likely satisfy the modernization of college football (with up to 12
        out of the 14 games being conference games). Since the Division I FCS, Division II, and Division III and do not enforce conference playoffs, implementing conference playoffs for Division I FBS seems unlikely.
        Conference playoffs would only happen if a drastic change to the FBS
        happens (such as the power conferences splitting away from the non-power
        FBS conferences, which I hope it doesn't happen).
      </p>
      <h2>The Army-Navy Dilemma</h2>
      <p>
        We would likely have to deal with the Army-Navy stand-alone if we want to
        make adjustments to the regular season. While still eliminating the
        conference championship games (and never implementing conference play-in
        games), there are two simple solutions that we can implement.
      </p>
      <h3>Army-Navy as Stand-Alone Season Opener</h3>
      <p>
        The first simplest solution is to move the Army-Navy stand-alone game as
        the stand-alone regular season opener to begin every FBS regular season.
        If we want to only keep the 12-game or 13-game regular season schedule, we
        would have the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
            <th>Opening Weekend</th>
            <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
            <th>Army-Navy</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">12</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 25-29</td>
            <td rowspan="4">
              Weekend Before Thanksgiving <br/>
              (Weekend of Nov. 17-23)
            </td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 18-22 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Weekend of Aug. 18-24</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Weekend of Aug. 11-17 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">13</td>
            <td>1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 16-17</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 9-10 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the regular season can be increased up to a 14-game schedule, while applying the adjusted 13-game regular season schedule, this is how the regular season would look:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
            <th>Opening Weekend</th>
            <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
            <th>Army-Navy</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>13</td>
            <td rowspan="2">1</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 18-24</td>
            <td rowspan="2">
              Weekend Before Thanksgiving <br/>
              (Weekend of Nov. 17-23)
            </td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 11-17 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>14</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Weekend of Aug. 11-17</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 4-10 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Moving Army-Navy as the Stand-Alone Friday Night Game</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of keeping a 12-game regular season schedule or expanding the regular season to a 13-game or 14-game schedule, we can still keep Army and Navy as a stand-alone game.  However, they would end on the same week as all the other FBS teams.  While the proposed 12-game, 13-game, and 14-game regular season schedules would still stay the same, here is how the regular season would happen when the week arrives:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Day of Week</th>
            <th>Kickoff Times (in EST)</th>
            <th>Event</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tues. Nov. 13-19</td>
            <td>7PM, 7:30PM, 8PM</td>
            <td>MAC Regular Season Rivalry Games</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Wed. Nov. 14-20</td>
            <td>7PM, 7:30PM, 8PM</td>
            <td>MAC Regular Season Rivalry Games</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Thurs. Nov. 15-21</td>
            <td>7PM, 7:30PM, 8PM</td>
            <td>Any Power/Non-Power FBS Regular Season Rivalry Game</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Fri. Nov. 16-22</td>
            <td>7:30PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Army-Navy</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sat. Nov. 17-23</td>
            <td>All Day</td>
            <td>Rivalry Week</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        While the starts to the regular seasons for the rest of the FBS would still remain the same, a simple move with the Army-Navy game allows flexibility to the playoff schedule.  
      </p>
      <h2>Postseason Adjustments</h2>
      <div class="warning-box">
      <b
        >Note: Specific bowl game assignments throughout this proposal are illustrative and subject to change based on bowl game availability, sponsorship changes, and conference realignment. The structural framework of the playoff and secondary playoff systems remains valid regardless of which specific bowl games ultimately participate.</b
      >
      </div>
      <p>
        With this adjustment only pertaining to Army-Navy, the 32-team playoff could begin as soon as Thanksgiving Weekend.  The proposed TV Networks and streaming will still apply.  However, the kickoff times will be a bit different.  The first-round kickoff dates, times, and airing networks would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>First Round</th>
            <th>Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 1 and 2</td>
            <td>Both at 12PM EST</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Fri. Nov. 23-29</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 3 and 4</td>
            <td>Both at 4PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 5 and 6</td>
            <td>Both at 8PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Games 7-16</td>
            <td>Some at 12PM</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Sat. Nov. 24-30</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Some at 3:30PM and/or 4PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Some at 7:30PM and/or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        By beginning the postseason on Thanksgiving Weekend, we have a bit more flexibility on the kickoff times for the first round.  We can have as many as 6-8 games kickoff on Black Friday.  However, because Prime also streams an NFL Black Friday game as well, we also will have to consider the simulcasted local channels too depending on which team is playing.   
      </p>
      <p>
        The second-round kickoff dates, times, and airing networks would be the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Two Second Round Games on Thursday Night</li>
          <li>Two Second Round Games on Friday Night</li>
          <li>Four Second Round Games on Saturday</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>The kickoff dates and times for the second-round games would then be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Second Round</th>
            <th>Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 1 and 2</td>
            <td rowspan="2">
              5:30PM and 9PM<br/>
              6PM and 9:30PM<br/>
              6:30PM and 10PM<br/>
              OR <br/>
              7PM and 10PM<br/>
            </td>
            <td>Thurs. Nov. 29 - Dec. 5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 3 and 4</td>
            <td>Fri. Nov. 30 - Dec. 6</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 5-8</td>
            <td>
              11AM, 2:30PM, 6PM, and 9:30PM<br/>
              OR<br/>
              12PM, 3:30PM, 7PM, and 10:30PM<br/>
            </td>
            <td>Sat. Dec. 1 - 7</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        The later pairings are only possible if the following happens:
        <ul>
          <li>At least one team seeded 1-8 from the Pacific and/or Mountain Time Zone advance to the second round</li>
          <li>At least one team seeded 9-16 from the Pacific and/or Mountain Time Zone advance and is paired with an unseeded team in the second round</li>
          <li>A pair of unseeded teams, where one of them is from Pacific and/or Mountain Time Zone; if the unseeded team from Pacific and/or Mountain Time is higher ranked, they would the designated host</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if there are no teams from Pacific and/or Mountain Time advancing to the second round, then for the Thursday and Friday kickoffs, either Pair 1 or 2 would apply.  For Saturday, the first pairing would apply.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The quarterfinal kickoff dates and times would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Quarterfinal</th>
            <th>Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 1</td>
            <td>8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 7 - 13</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 2</td>
            <td>12PM</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Sat. Dec. 8 - 14</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 3</td>
            <td>4PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 4</td>
            <td>8PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the quarterfinals would happen on the second weekend of December, we don’t have to worry about the NFL here.  Finally, the final two rounds would have the following kickoff times:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>New Year's Falls on</th>
            <th>Semfinals Kickoff Date and Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sunday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 16 8PM, Sat. Dec. 17 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 6 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Monday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 15 8PM, Sat. Dec. 16 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 5 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tuesday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 14 8PM, Sat. Dec. 15 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 4 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Wednesday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 20 8PM, Sat. Dec. 21 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 3 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Thursday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 19 8PM, Sat. Dec. 20 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 2 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Friday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 18 8PM, Sat. Dec. 19 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 1 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Saturday</td>
            <td>Fri. Dec. 17 8PM, Sat. Dec. 18 12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan. 7 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        For this scenario, the first semifinal game would always kickoff on a Friday Night.  The second semifinal game would depend on whether the NFL Doubleheader would be in the afternoon or in the late-afternoon and night.  Here is when the second semifinal game would happen depending on the NFL
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NFL Saturday Doubleheader Kickoff Times (in EST)</th>
            <th>Semifinal Saturday Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1PM and 4:30PM</td>
            <td>8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4:30PM and 8PM</td>
            <td>12PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the National Championship game would kickoff on the first Friday of January (or the second Saturday of January if New Year's Day falls on a Friday).
      </p>
      <h3>Continued Importance of Consolation Bowl Games</h3>
      <p>
        If we move forward with this adjusted 32-team playoff schedule, the consolation bowl games become required.  If the 32-team playoff field is moved up one week early, bowl games would no longer be able to become playoff hosts.  Currently, there are 40 bowl games (the LA Bowl has recently discontinued).  If we have a 32-team field, plus those 40 leftover bowl games, we would have the following:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Total</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
              <th>Composition</th>
              <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>112</td>
              <td>136</td>
              <td>67.6%</td>
              <td>
                32 Teams to the FBS Playoffs <br/>
                80 Teams to Bowl Games
              </td>
              <td>71 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the CFP decides to not implement consolation bowl games for eliminated playoff participants,  we would increase the selection percentage to 82.4% because after selecting those 32 teams to the FBS playoffs, we would have about 50 bowl eligible teams remaining.  That means that at least 30 more teams with losing records would be invited to play in bowl games.  You would be inviting much more teams with losing records to play in bowl games, which is not ideal.  Here is a further breakdown if you are curious:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Postseason</th>
            <th>Selected</th>
            <th>Postseason Games</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>FBS Playoffs</td>
            <td>32 Teams</td>
            <td>31 Playoff Games</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bowl Games</td>
            <td>80 Teams</td>
            <td>40 Bowl Games</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Total</td>
            <td>112 Teams</td>
            <td>71 Postseason Games</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the consolation bowl games in the adjusted 32-team playoff schedule, it’s almost back to the BCS days.  However, bowls would be tiered based on the overall finish in the FBS playoffs.  The tiers and tie-ins for each bowl game would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Bowl Game</th>
            <th>Tier</th>
            <th>Year A Tie-In</th>
            <th>Year B Tie-In</th>
            <th>Year C Tie-In</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Rose Bowl</td>
            <td>Tier 1</td>
            <td>3rd Place Game</td>
            <td>Quarterfinalists</td>
            <td>Quarterfinalists</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sugar Bowl</td>
            <td>Tier 1</td>
            <td>Quarterfinalists</td>
            <td>3rd Place Game</td>
            <td>Quarterfinalists</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Orange Bowl</td>
            <td>Tier 1</td>
            <td>Quarterfinalists</td>
            <td>Quarterfinalists</td>
            <td>3rd Place Game</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Cotton Bowl</td>
            <td>Tier 2</td>
            <td>2nd Round Participants</td>
            <td>2nd Round Participants</td>
            <td>2nd Round Participants</td>

        Basically, we have 15 consolation bowl games for any of the 30 teams that did not make it to the National Championship game.  Three of the four oldest bowl games (Rose, Sugar, and Orange) all get the highest prestige in that they get the best teams who at least made it to the quarterfinals, but failed to either advance to the semifinals or advance all the way to the National Championship Game.  Those three bowl games will rotate on whoever will host the 3rd place game in a 3-year cycle.  This is what the overall postseason composition would have looked like if we only expanded the playoff to 16 teams without implementing the consolation bowl games for playoff participants:
        <table>

            <th>Selected</th>

            <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
          </tr>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a further breakdown if you are curious:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Postseason</th>
            <th>Selected</th>

        Along with the 15 bowl games for eliminated playoff participants, we would have 31 playoff games (however, no bowl game would host the National Championship Game).  Then, we would have 25 bowl games for those eliminated in the playoffs.  In total, we would have a total of 71 postseason games with 82 teams participating.  Both the quality of the remaining bowl games as well as the quality pool of bowl eligible teams would not decline as much with the implementation of the consolation bowl games.

        If we take a closer look, the number of teams as well as the number of postseason games are almost the same.  However, the only biggest disadvantage is that you will now begin to invite teams with losing records to fill out the bowl games.  With a total of 64 teams invited to either playoff, you would still have 6 bowl eligible teams remaining.

        Scheduling the championship games would not be as difficult since the adjusted main 32-team field would have one semifinal game each on Friday and Saturday.  The National Playoff Invitational and the College Playoff Crown will alternate kickoff times.  However, they will have to see the kickoff date to the FBS semifinal of the adjusted 32-team playoff schedule.  If the Saturday FBS semifinal game kicks off at 8PM ET, the secondary playoff times would be the following:

        If the Saturday FBS semifinal game kicks off at 12PM ET, the secondary playoff times would be the following:
        <table>

      <h2>Off the Field Adjustments</h2>
      <p>
        If we make the simple adjustments to the regular season as well as the 32-team playoff schedules, we only need to make the following adjustments:
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate the early signing period</li>
          <li>Move up the 15-day transfer portal period</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliminating the early signing period should be very straightforward.  If the 32-team playoff begins on Thanksgiving weekend, the only signing period that would happen is the National Signing Day, which would return to its original dates. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The transfer portal period would then have the following periods:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
            <th>Transfer Portal Period</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 1</td>
            <td>January 2 - 16</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 2</td>
            <td>January 3 - 17</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 3</td>
            <td>January 4 - 18</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 4</td>
            <td>January 5 - 19</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 5</td>
            <td>January 6 - 20</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 6</td>
            <td>January 7 - 21</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>January 7</td>
            <td>January 8 - 22</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
