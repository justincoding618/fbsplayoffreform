      <h1>Recent NFL Changes</h1>
      <p>
        The NFL made some recent changes to their regular season and playoff
        format. Since 1978, the NFL played a 16-game regular season schedule, with
        the exception of the truncated 1982 season that led to a transitory
        16-team playoff for the 1982-83 season. The NFL also held a 12-team
        playoff format from 1990-2020. The top two teams in the AFC (American
        Football Conference) and NFC (National Football Conference) earn a
        first-round bye while the remaining four teams in the AFC and NFC battle
        it out in the wildcard round.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2020, the players union and the NFL approved the playoffs to
        expand to 14 teams and extend the regular season to 17 games. The
        preseason was downsized to three games to accommodate the expanded regular
        season. The biggest reason for the approval is the revenue that comes out
        of the new regular season and playoff format. The start of the regular
        season remained on the Thursday after Labor Day. With a 17-game regular
        season, teams would finish the regular season on the first or second
        Sunday of January, with date ranges between Saturday Jan. 3-9 and Sunday Jan. 4-10.
      </p>
      <h2>Current NFL Regular Season</h2>
      <p>
        In addition, the NFL also would change their Regular Season Finale
        Schedule. For Week 18, the NFL would schedule two games on the first or
        second Saturday of January as part of the NFL regular season finale. Both
        would air on ABC/ESPN, but one would kick off at 4:35PM EST and the second
        would kick off on 8:15PM EST. The rest of the Week 18 Sunday schedule
        would remain the same, where one game could be flexed to Sunday Night if
        there is enough incentive to warrant it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NFL also made Thursday Night games only available on Amazon Prime
        since 2022. Although NFL Thursday Night Games (from September-December)
        are streamed exclusively on Amazon Prime nationally, the streamed games
        are also locally simulcasted in each team’s media market depending on
        which team is playing on that Thursday night. This now also applies to the
        NFL Wildcard Game since the 2024-25 NFL playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may wonder which media team’s local channels would the Amazon Prime
        games be televised on? If any two NFL teams play on Thursday Night (or
        have their wildcard game streamed), the channels that televise the games
        would happen in the following media market (depending on who is playing on
        Amazon Prime):

        <small><sup>*</sup>The Packers TV Network airs Packers games locally when it’s on a Thursday Night (or is preseason) outside of Green Bay in St. Louis, MO (FOX), Peoria, IL (CBS), Omaha, NE (ABC), and various select cities in Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Alaska (airing locally on ABC, NBC, FOX, or CBS depending on the city).</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, say the 49ers and the Eagles play on Thursday Night.  Since both of those games air on FOX in the local San Francisco and Philadelphia markets, it means that FOX may not be available as a channel to kick off a college football Thursday Night playoff game.  However, there are exceptions.  For example, while the World Series happened in 2022, where the Phillies were playing against the Astros, Games 3-5 of the World Series games were moved over by one day after the original dates due to inclement weather in Philadelphia.  The Eagles-Texans Thursday Night game was moved to the CW in Philadelphia and in Houston because Game 5 was moved to November 3, 2022 (the day the Eagles and Texans kicked off).  Therefore, FOX was not available for those local markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the NFL Network late-Saturday regular season games would also be simulcasted on the local ABC, CBS, FOX, or NBC channels of the respective NFL teams’ media markets.  The simulcast of NFL Network games is similar to the simulcast of the Amazon Prime streamed games.   Any of the local TV market’s ABC, CBS, FOX, or NBC channels would simulcast the NFL Network games depending on which teams are playing.  For example, if the Houston Texans and the LA Chargers played on Saturday at 4:30PM and it is on NFL Network, one of the local (ABC, CBS, FOX, or NBC) channels in Houston and Los Angeles would simulcast the NFL Network game on that given Saturday.
      </p>
      <h2>Current NFL Playoffs</h2>
      <p>
        The NFL playoffs would begin on the second weekend of January or, if January 1 or 2 falls on a Saturday, the third weekend of January, and would end on the second Sunday of February.  Speaking of the playoffs, with the NFL expanding the playoffs to 14 teams, six wildcard games would kick off after the NFL regular season.  In the first 14-team playoff postseason (2020-21 NFL Playoffs), three games would kick off on Saturday and three more would kick off on Sunday.  The following is how the NFL wildcard schedule looked when they first expanded the field to 14 teams:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NFL Wildcard Weekend</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date and Time</th>
            <th>TV Network</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 1</td>
            <td>Jan. 10 - 16 1:05PM EST</td>
            <td rowspan="5">ESPN/ABC, CBS, FOX, or NBC</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>

        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 2021-22 NFL Playoffs, one wildcard game kicked off on a Monday Night.  The Monday Night Wildcard game would always air on ESPN/ABC, while the Sunday Night Wildcard Game always aired on NBC.  In addition, since the 2024-25 playoffs, Amazon Prime streams one NFL playoff game.  Therefore, the current format looks like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NFL Wildcard Weekend</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date and Time</th>

      </p>
      <p>
        The number one seeds in the AFC and NFC are now the only teams to earn a first-round bye.  The Monday Wildcard winner would be guaranteed to play their Divisional Round game on Sunday of the next weekend.  The Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs currently like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NFL Divisional Round</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date and Time</th>

          <tr>
            <th>NFL Championship Games</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date and Time</th>

      </p>
      <h2>Potential Push to an 18-Game Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        The NFL once again is planning to adjust the regular season.  The NFL is attempting to go into an 18-game regular season.  The NFL going to an 18-game schedule seems inevitable and is definitely something to monitor.  It could happen sometime before the next NFL CBA agreement is reached.
      </p>
      <h2>Workarounds</h2>
      <p>
        With the proposed 32-team playoff schedule to start on the first weekend of December, we have more flexibility to workaround the NFL as this would only affect the National Championship game.  You can learn more about this in <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/proposed-process/kickoff-dates-and-times.html">the proposed kickoff dates and times</a>.
      <h3>NFL Draft Declarations</h3>
      <p>
        NFL Draft declarations for college players will also depend on the proposed schedule that would advance.   Usually, the date to declare for the Draft would happen one week after the National Championship game.  The date to declare for the draft will very likely depend on when the National Championship Game would be scheduled.  Here is how the new NFL Draft Declarations deadline would look depending on the date of the National Championship Game:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
            <th>Deadline to Declare for NFL Draft</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 8</td>
            <td>Jan. 15</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 9</td>
            <td>Jan. 16</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 10</td>
            <td>Jan. 17</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 11</td>
            <td>Jan. 18</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 12</td>
            <td>Jan. 19</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 13</td>
            <td>Jan. 20</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Jan. 14</td>
            <td>Jan. 21</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        The National Championship Game date varies based on when New Year's Day falls and NFL scheduling considerations (see <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/proposed-process/kickoff-dates-and-times.html">kickoff dates and times</a> for details), which determines the corresponding draft declaration deadline.
