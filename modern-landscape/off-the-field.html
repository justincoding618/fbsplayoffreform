    <h1>Off the Field</h1>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      One of the major issues with implementing a new format is how it will
      impact off-the-field, especially pertaining to the academic standards at the respective universities. As I mentioned earlier,
      universities have diverse academic calendars. Most universities enforce a
      two-semester academic system. However, some universities do not do a
      two-semester academic system. Some universities still enforce a
      four-quarter system, where three of the four quarters would count as a
      collegiate academic year. This leads to differing final exam schedules
      across different universities. Student athletes are also busy with
      juggling academics, football practices, and other aspects of life outside
      of football. We can definitely work the playoff schedule around the
      student athletes’ concerns, the diverse final exam schedules and start
      dates of new quarters, semesters, and trimesters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life as a Division I FBS player is a lot of hard work. They need to
      participate in football practices, training sessions, film sessions, and
      attend classes, whether virtually or in-person. Since most student
      athletes go about 10-15 hours of practice per week, student athletes
      during the semester would only have time for 6 total credit hour courses.
      If they can handle more than 6 credit hours, then more power to them. Most
      student athletes are on-campus for the majority of their summer break.
      Summer courses are definitely strongly recommended for student athletes in
      order to get the tougher courses out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a typical football schedule during the regular season, the student
      athlete would have to go through the similar following schedule:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Activity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5AM-6AM</td>
          <td>Wake Up, Eat Breakfast, Pack for the Day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6-8AM</td>
          <td>Strength and Conditioning</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8-8:30AM</td>
          <td>Team Meeting to Review Practice Schedule</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8:30-9AM</td>
          <td>Shower and Go to Classes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9AM-2PM</td>
          <td>Classes and Lunch</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2-2:30PM</td>
          <td>Watch Game Film</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2:30-3:15PM</td>
          <td>Get Taped Before Practice</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3:30-6PM</td>
          <td>Practice with the Team</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6-7PM</td>
          <td>Shower and Training</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7-7:30PM</td>
          <td>Dinner</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7:30-9:30PM</td>
          <td>Academic Support Center</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9:30PM-12AM</td>
          <td>Head Home, Finish Homework, Sleep</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is what I would propose to every FBS school if academics and student life is still an issue to the new 32-Team Division I FBS playoffs and possibly the regular season
    </p>
    <h2>Preseason Camp</h2>
    <p>
      Preseason Camp rules will likely remain the same. As of January 2017, NCAA made the following changes regarding the preseason:
      <ul>
        <li>Discontinue two-a-day practices. (A second session may include walkthroughs or meetings but no helmets, pads, or conditioning.)</li>
        <li>Extend the preseason by one week.</li>
        <li>Reduce live tackling or thud practices from four to three a week.</li>
        <li>Ensure three noncontact or minimal contact practices per week.</li>
        <li>Ensure noncontact or minimal contact practices happen the day after a scrimmage.</li>
        <li>Implement one day per week without practice.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the start to Fall Camp will become different.  It would depend on when the regular season would start.  Fall Camp for a semester-based team could look like the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Depending on when the regular season would begin, here is how Fall Camp would happen with the differing starts to the regular season:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Opening Regular Season Date</th>
              <th>Fall Camp Start Date</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Aug. 11-15</td>
              <td>July 11-15</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Aug. 16-17</td>
              <td>July 16-17</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Aug. 18-24</td>
              <td>July 18-24</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Aug. 25-29</td>
              <td>July 25-29	</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          If the regular season starts early, schools would start Fall Camp earlier.  Notice how Fall Camp still starts at least one week after Independence Day.  I understand that starting Fall Camp early may be a hard sell for some.  However, this would be a tradeoff for those who don’t want the postseason to extend well into January.  In addition, as long as it’s not as big of a deal, then this should be ok.
        </li>
        <li> Campus Tour Day: Any following weekday after the Last Weekend of July or First Weekend of August </li>
        <li>Scrimmage Day: Any following weekday after Campus Tour</li>
        <li>If students have summer courses, camp would start at 5PM up until the last day of summer courses</li>
        <li>After the conclusion of summer courses for the respective universities, camp will then start at 9:30AM up to when classes begin during the part of fall camp</li>
        <li>When a Semester Begins, football practices would begin at 6AM or 5PM for the regular season</li>
      </ul>
    </p>	
    <p>
      Fall Camp for a team with a quarter-based or trimester-based system would have the same or similar starting times to semester-based teams.  However, for those teams, their starting class times for the Fall Trimester or Fall Quarter would start later than teams with a semester-based system, but the proposed starting times to preseason practices will still apply.  
    </p>	
    <h2>Weekly Practices During the Regular Season</h2>
    <p>
      The Power Conferences voted to disallow athletically related activities other than competition during a continuous eight-hour window between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.  In other words, regardless of whether football teams should hold practice in the morning, afternoon, or evening, academic scheduling conflicts would still occur.  If football practices happen in the afternoon, then student athletes would not be able to schedule classes in the afternoon and the same applies to scheduling conflicts to morning practices and morning courses.  In 2017, the NCAA also made these following changes in football practices during the regular season:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In season is the period between six days prior to the first regular-season game and the final regular-season game or conference championship game (for participating institutions).  During the regular season, coaches can customize the weekly practice schedule that would be conducive to both the coaches and student athletes.  However, coaches can only do the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Permit only one live contact tackling practice per week.</li>
            <li>Permit only one live contact thud practice per week.</li>
            <li>Implement three or more noncontact or minimal contact practices per week. Non-contact practices include workouts, walkthroughs, and meetings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is neither a correct nor a wrong way for FBS universities to enforce football practices during the regular season.  Whenever they happen, football practices should have as little overlap with the main hours of courses, which would be 8AM-5PM local time, as possible.  During the regular season (during the fall quarter or fall semester), in order to get the best out of student athletes during the Fall Quarter, Semester, or Trimester, student athletes will still be able to take all their classes for the majority of the day while having college football practices.   All football practices will cover both the 90-minute and max-allotted 2-hour afternoon or evening practices.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If FBS universities decide to move all football practices in the morning, I would propose the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Activity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5AM-6AM</td>
          <td>Wake Up, Eat Breakfast, Pack for the Day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6-6:30AM</td>
          <td>Team Meeting to Review Practice Schedule</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6:30-8:30AM</td>
          <td>Strength and Conditioning</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8:30-9:30AM</td>
          <td>Watch Game Film and Get Taped Before Practice </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9:30-12AM</td>
          <td>Practice with the Team</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>12-12:30PM</td>
          <td>Shower and Go to Classes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>12:30-6PM</td>
          <td>Lunch and Classes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6-7:30PM</td>
          <td>Dinner, Shower and Training</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7:30-9PM</td>
          <td>Academic Support Center</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9:30-12PM</td>
          <td>Head Home, Finish Homework, Sleep</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      For evening practices only, I would propose the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Activity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5AM-6AM</td>
          <td>Wake Up, Eat Breakfast, Pack for the Day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6-6:30AM</td>
          <td>Team Meeting to Review Practice Schedule</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6:30-8:30AM</td>
          <td>Strength and Conditioning</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8:30-9AM</td>
          <td>Shower and Go to Classes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9AM-2PM</td>
          <td>Classes and Lunch</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2-4PM</td>
          <td>Academic Support Center</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4-5PM</td>
          <td>Watch Game Film and Get Taped Before Practice</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5-7:30PM</td>
          <td>Practice with the Team </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7:30-9PM</td>
          <td>Shower, Dinner and Training</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9PM-12AM</td>
          <td>Head Home, Finish Homework, Sleep</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      You will notice that all student athletes would have a 5 to 5.5-hour period solely for academics.  For morning practices, the lunch break would happen concluding the morning practice, and would have courses for five hours.  For the evening practices, the lunch break would happen in-between class sessions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular season football practices for every Saturday game will depend on how coaches would like to customize their weeks that would feel conducive to both them and student athletes.  If coaches prefer to do practices in the morning, football practices would not begin until Monday morning to ensure that both coaches and student athletes feel rested after every Saturday game.  If coaches enforce a two-a-day, thud practices and contact practices are mandatory and will occur on the first part of the two-a-day starting at 6AM.  Non-contact practices will compose the second part of the two-a-day football workout.  In addition, student athletes will have the option to schedule additional workouts to work around their academic schedules during the afternoon.  On the Friday before every Saturday game, there will be morning practice.  The rest of the day will depend on whether the game is at home or on the road.  If the game is at home, student athletes will worry about courses for the rest of the day. If the team has to travel to the stadium site, they will have to miss class and use Friday afternoon to travel to the city of the stadium site and stay overnight.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If coaches prefer to do practices later during the day, they will have the option to administer football practices starting Sunday after every Saturday game, but no earlier than 5PM, and using Monday as the day off for student athletes to focus on academics.  If coaches enforce a two-a-day, thud practices and contact practices are mandatory and will transpire on the second part of the two-a-day starting at 5PM.  Non-contact practices will compose the second part of the two-a-day football workout.  In addition, student athletes will have the option to schedule additional workouts to work around their academic schedules during the morning and afternoon.  However, all student athletes will need to reschedule all evening exams if they have scheduled evening exams.  If coaches prefer to do practices later during the day, the Friday practices before every Saturday game are non-contact only.  The rest of the day will depend on whether the game is at home or on the road.  If the game is at home, student athletes will worry about courses during the day. If the team has to travel to the stadium site, they will have to miss class and use Friday afternoon as non-contact practice day, to travel to the city of the stadium site and stay overnight.
    </p>
    <h3>Non-Saturday Games</h3>
    <p>
      A non-Saturday game and the week after teams have common bye weeks during the regular season is the ideal scheduling of multiple non-Saturday games.  However, if teams have a non-Saturday game after their Saturday game, then depending on when FBS teams hold practice in the morning or evening, practice will transpire from Sunday or Monday to Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, depending on when the non-Saturday game kicks off.  The only ideal way to schedule at least two consecutive non-Saturday games is to schedule them in consecutive weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are different scenarios of scheduling non-Saturday games: 
      <ul>
        <li>If the game falls on Friday, then practice will be from Sunday or Monday through Thursday following a Saturday game or bye week, with Saturday and/or Sunday used as rest days only after the game.  If the game is on the road, visiting teams will use the Thursday Morning to practice and will travel to the city of the stadium site.  After the Friday game, visiting teams will travel back to their home campus.  Saturday and Sunday will become rest days.  However, if there is another non-Saturday game falling on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of the next week, then practice resumes on Sunday, with Saturday being the only rest day.</li>
        <li>If the game falls on Thursday, then practice will be from Sunday or Monday through Wednesday following a Saturday game or bye week.  If the game is on the road, visiting teams will use the Wednesday Morning to practice and will travel to the city of the stadium site.  After the Thursday game, Friday and Saturday will become rest days. Practice will resume on Sunday, regardless if there is another non-Saturday game falling on either Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of the next week or a Saturday game.</li>
        <li>If the game falls on Tuesday or Wednesday, then only 2-3 consecutive days will work following either a Saturday game or bye week.  If the game is on the road, visiting teams will use the day before the Tuesday or Wednesday game in the morning to practice and will travel to the city of the stadium site.  Friday and Saturday will become rest days.  Practice will resume on Sunday regardless if there is another non-Saturday game falling on either Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of the next week or a Saturday game.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are different scenarios of scheduling games within Labor Day weekend: 
      <ul>
        <li>If teams decide to play on Sunday before Labor Day Weekend, then those two teams will still have a scheduled game the next Saturday.  In addition, Monday will be a rest day and practices will occur from Tuesday-Friday before their next game. </li>
        <li>If teams decide to play on Labor Day, then those two teams will have a scheduled game the next Saturday.  Teams that participated in the Labor Day Game will use Tuesday as a rest day, and practice would happen on Wednesday-Friday before their next Saturday game.  </li>
        <li>If, however, a non-Saturday game kicks off the following Saturday game other than the opening week, especially in the months of October and November, then teams would have a short week preparation to prepare for the next opponent, depending on whether the non-Saturday game is on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Taking Care of Academics</h2>
    <p>
      With football practices happening before or after the majority of the course day during Fall season, this will free up the entire day.  Although student athletes would not be able to take classes in certain time periods (depending on when practice happens), they will still be able to schedule classes where time is available.  If their major of interest offers courses over the summer, they should be able to take advantage of them and take harder courses during those times.  While the majority of coaches implement football practices later in the day in the afternoon or evening, some college coaches have implemented morning practice instead of traditionally practicing later in the day.
    </p>
    <h3>Ways for Student Athlets to Graduate High School Early</h3>
    <p>
      Prospective collegiate student athletes should be encouraged to take AP (advanced placement), IB (international baccalaureate) courses, and/or dual credit high school-college courses in high school.  These courses will help lessen the semester load for student athletes who are willing to do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Graduate within three years</li>
        <li>Pursue any major or double major.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It will also help them give them a head start in college academics.  Although high school seniors leave in May, those last days for high school seniors can be different from university start times for the summer sessions, especially for those that hold a Maymester concluding the Spring Semester.
    </p>
    <h3>Professor and University Support</h3>
    <p>
      Professors do provide office hours for all students.  Professors encourage all students to come visit them or contact them if they need assistance.  Encourage players to arrange one-on-one or group appointments with professors if they cannot make their office hours.  
      <ul>
        <li>This will help them catch up on academics and for those who are struggling to succeed in academics. </li>
        <li>Professors should also be supportive to all students, including student athletes.  Having that support system would give them confidence that they will succeed in the classroom along with football.</li>
        <li>Do not encourage academic dishonesty, which includes plagiarism, cheating, and having other students or even faculty, staff members or coaches do homework for them.  Academic dishonesty will result in an automatic failure for the work or for the course pending on the severity stated in the corresponding university’s academic policies. It also results in an NCAA violation as well.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If problems do arise in trying to graduate or concerns with overwhelming course work and exams, universities have wellness centers, academic retention services, and tutors.  However, if any university does not have any wellness center, then I strongly recommend universities installing one to make sure students’ mental health are being well during their time studying.  All academic retention services should not just help the student athlete stay academically eligible.  Universities should help the student athletes with creating their own personal schedules, which would help balance football practice or other athletic activities with study times, important events such as Career Fairs, and other leisure activities, such as scheduling naptime or taking yoga classes.  The football coaching staff can also help football student athletes in that regard as well, such as the Real-Life Wednesdays Program at Ohio State.  However, none of these resources should encourage academic dishonesty.  In addition, universities also have career centers that would help students prepare themselves for a permanent job if having a sustained football career does not work out.  All universities offer courses that would help students prepare for interviews that would eventually lead to a job offer.  Others have gone beyond helping student athletes prepare for life after athletics.
    </p>
    <h2>Postseason With Academics and Practice</h2>
    Implementing a new postseason format with academics would impact the practices, the student’s final exam schedules, and if graduating in December, Fall Commencement.  The biggest questions that would come with the transition would be the following:
    <ul>
      <li>How can student athletes balance academics with the newly extended postseason football?</li>
      <li>How would student athletes gain their degrees if they graduate in the Fall?</li>
      <li>What would they need to do in order to be able to complete their final exams in a timely manner before they leave for the postseason?</li>
      <li>What are some other factors to consider?  Why should we consider them?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Weekly Practices During Postseason</h3>
    <p>
      Practice rules while the 32-team playoff field happens could potentially use both in-season and postseason rules regarding football practices.  As of January 2017, the NCAA made these following changes in football practices during the regular and postseasons:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In Season:
          <ul>
            <li>Permit only one live contact tackling practice per week.</li>
            <li>Permit only one live contact thud practice per week.</li>
            <li>Implement three or more noncontact or minimal contact practices per week. Non-contact practices include workouts, walkthroughs, and meetings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Postseason: 
          <p>
            If there is a two-week or less period of time between final regular-season or conference championship game and a bowl or postseason game, then in-season practice will still apply.  If more than two weeks elapse between the final regular-season or conference championship game and a bowl or postseason game, the following can happen:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow up to three practices per week of live contact (including two thud)</li>
            <li>Add three days of noncontact or minimal contact practices per week</li>
            <li>Ensure the day preceding and after live contact-tackling practices should be noncontact or minimal contact or no football practice.</li>
            <li>One day must have no football practice.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The postseason rules for football practice would also apply to the new 32-team Division I FBS Playoffs.  It would occur between after the conference championship games or final regular season game for the 136 FBS teams.  Football practices will still happen in the morning during either the full final exam week or majority of the final exam period and fall commencement. However, student athletes will have to move all morning final exams to the afternoon or evening. This will ensure that student athletes will be able to focus on final exams after getting football practices done first thing in the morning.  
    </p>
    <h3>Working Around Diverse Final Exam Schedules</h3>
    <p>
      FCS playoff teams have gone through their playoffs while having divergent academic schedules and finals week.  If FBS universities do not want unified final exam schedules and academic semesters and/or quarters across all FBS universities, then universities scheduling their academic years and final exams will remain the same.  However, some universities schedule weekend finals (Saturday and/or Sunday Finals).  In addition, all universities have differing start times to their respective quarters, semesters, and trimesters.  In an event when the FBS playoffs occur during finals week and during the beginning of the winter quarter, spring semester, or winter trimester, the following major adjustments will occur to ensure that balancing football postseason and final exams would become conducive for student athletes during the FBS postseason:
    </p>
    <h4>Cooperation Between Universites, Professors, and Student Athletes</h4>
    <p>
      If possible, student athletes will need to contact professors/instructors and their respective university office of registrars immediately to arrange final exams that would be conducive for them and with the professors/instructors.  Universities, especially the university of registrars, should allow student athletes, and feasibly every student (including band members and cheerleaders), to reschedule final exams between when final exams officially begin until the last day of finals during the final exam period for extenuating circumstances that will prevent them from taking their final exams at the scheduled time.  For teams holding morning practices, student athletes must reschedule any of their morning final exams to anytime on Monday or any weekday afternoon or evening during the final exam period.  For teams holding evening practices, student athletes must reschedule any of their evening final exams to anytime on Monday or any weekday morning or afternoon during the final exam period.  Any other students involved in the football event (cheerleading, band members, etc.) can schedule make-up exams from the first day of final exams up until the day they would need to travel with the coaching staff and other teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      No university should schedule weekend final exams.  This is so all students would avoid missing final exams due to an event.  However, if any university decides to uphold their decision to continue overseeing final exams over the weekend, then student athletes will have to contact their professors and university of registrars to reschedule any of their Saturday and/or Sunday final exams to anytime on Monday or any weekday afternoon during the final exam period.  University of registrars will also contact professors to confirm the rescheduling of any Saturday and/or Sunday final exams.  As long as student athletes and any other involved students take and pass their final exams before professors submit their final grades, they should be in good academic standing.  The only exception to this rule is if professors do not enforce a final exam in their courses or if the final exams are optional. 
    </p>
    <h4>Postseason Practices</h4>
    <p>
      During the postseason after Thanksgiving Break, especially when final exams do occur, all morning and evening football practices will still occur at their respective starting times.  Morning practices would still start no earlier than 6AM local time and up until 9AM.  All evening football practices would still start no earlier than 5PM and end at 8PM.  Two-a-day practices will still transpire for 3 hours.  Student athletes can still focus on final exams before or after football practices during finals week.  Student athletes will still have the option to leave morning practice a little early for their late-morning final exams or come later in the evening practice after their afternoon final exams.  During the final exam period, teams will not hold football practice during the first day of the full week containing the majority of the final exam period and commencement, which is usually on Monday.  
    </p>
    <h4>Fall Commencement</h4>
    <p>
      If graduating after the Fall Semester, Quarter, or Trimester, student athletes would have the following options:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Forgo the commencement, participate in team’s practices and the playoff game, and have their diplomas mailed to them. 
          <ul>
            <li>Student athletes must provide their mailing address to their respective major departments if they choose this option.  This is the best option if they want to travel and to help their teammates survive and advance closer to the coveted National Championship.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If Fall Commencement falls on the same day as the playoff game, the player can attend commencement, but must sit out of the team’s practices for that week and the playoff game to do so.</li>
        <li>
          If commencement of their academic department occurs one day before or after the playoff game, they can attend commencement and participate in practices and the playoff game for that week. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the game is on the road, they must also do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>If the commencement happens the day before or after the game, then student athletes will be unavailable for media interviews in order to give student athletes time to travel back to campus and to prepare for commencement. </li>
        <li>If the commencement occurs the day of the playoff game, then student athletes will only have the options between (a) and (b).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>January Postseason Practices</h4>
    <p>
      When a new quarter, semester, or trimester begins, football practices will return to the morning for the remaining playoff games.  If any student athlete is part of a team that has made it past the quarterfinals (or second round depending on the proposed format), they will still be able to schedule morning and afternoon courses during the spring semester, winter quarter, or winter trimester.  However, if their team does morning practice, student athletes would have classes no earlier than 9AM since morning football practice will occur starting at 6AM and ending at 9AM.  If teams do evening practice, student athletes would have classes until 5PM since evening football practice will occur starting at 5PM and ending no later than 8PM.  Teams can still enforce two-a-days.  However, the two-a-days must be both contact and non-contact practices OR minimal contact and non-contact practices.  January practices should occur no more than 3 hours per day, or 15-20 hours per week. All teams will hold mandatory practice on Thursday evening or Friday morning to finish preparing for any December and January postseason game, which will depend on when the kickoff to those postseason playoff games will happen.  For visiting teams, they will leave to the stadium site late afternoon or early evening before Game Day, regardless of the kickoff times.
    </p>
    <h3>Working with Diverse Academic Schedules</h3>
    <p>
      If the first two rounds of the playoff games during the universities’ respective fall final exam periods were non-issues, then my proposed playoff schedules will still apply.   Regardless of whether universities decide to keep their schedules as programmed or adjust and/or change their academic schedules, my proposed academics and postseason balance will give student athletes their opportunity to do the following: 
      <ul>
        <li>Morning and evening football practice would help put football as the first or the last part of the day, and aid students to prepare and focus on final exams and courses and the beginning of a new semester, quarter, or trimester.</li>
        <li>Resume football practice concluding the Fall Semester or Fall Quarter Final Exam Period</li>
        <li>Adapt to their spring semester or winter quarter courses if postseason occur during January (depending on academic format) and avoid missing too much time off-campus for postseason events.  </li>
        <li>If final exams and postseason games do not become an issue, then potentially provide all football coaching staffs at least a full week after Thanksgiving to close out recruits for the December Signing Period if their team makes the playoffs. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Non-Athlete Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      Any avid college student who also support their respective football teams would like to watch their team in-person play in December postseason games.  However, unless the postseason games kick off before the main finals’ week, they will have to complete their December final exams before attending the college football postseason games.  For the January postseason games, students will have to talk to their respective professors/instructors that they will be missing class time if he or she is using at least one weekday to travel to the postseason event.  The rules for student athletes during Finals Week will apply to other students, including band members, cheerleaders, and passionate fans.  If the postseason kicks off during the final exam period, they must complete all of their final exams one day before the kickoff times during finals week, depending on the kickoff times for the postseason games.  Graduate students have less flexibility as they are very busy with their coursework and/or research with their faculty advisors, so they may not have as much time off in their work than others. 
    </p>
    <h3>Other Factors to Consider</h3>
    <p>
      The following are some other problems that can come up, especially in the later round of the FBS playoffs.  Some schools start spring courses one or two weeks before Martin Luther King Day, while some begin after Martin Luther King Day.  Student athletes, cheerleaders, and band members would have to make up course work for time they are not on-campus.  In addition, the NCAA also has a rule of football practices reduced to 20 hours per week during the duration of classes, which would provide disadvantages to holding postseason practices beyond New Year’s Day.  Would they be okay with spending most of winter break traveling to different sites to contend for a national championship?  How much can they keep up with missed course material while traveling consecutive weeks?
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have to answer these questions, the answer is that the student would look at this as a positive experience.  However, as winter quarter, winter trimester, or spring semester begins, they would also have academic work to make up when they return to campus.  They would feel overwhelmed but have the perseverance to get them done.  However, sometimes the overwhelming feeling would win out and that could lead to bad mental health, which could become worse.  In fact, this is only possible if and only if schools require travel accommodations, provide, and give personalized help and advice to all students involved on finding ways to make up academic work for the first one to two weeks of the winter quarter, winter trimester, or spring semester courses.  If the New Year’s Bowl Games host the quarterfinals, I propose the FBS Semifinals and Championship Game to kick off over the weekends to prevent visiting student athletes, band members, coaches, and cheerleaders from returning to campus late and to reduce time student athletes, band members, coaches, and cheerleaders are away from campus.
