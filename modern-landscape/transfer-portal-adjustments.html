    <h1>Transfer Portal Adjustments</h1>
    <p>
      Let’s talk about the transfer portal. The purpose of the transfer portal
      is to allow players opportunities to go to a different school if their
      current school isn’t working out. After entering the transfer portal, they
      can seek opportunities. They can continue to seek opportunities as long as
      the player is still in the portal even after the transfer portal period
      expires. If they decide to withdraw their name from the portal, they
      cannot talk with other schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transfer portal was first introduced on October 15, 2018 to help
      student athletes in all sports manage their transfers between colleges. It
      has since evolved to allow players more freedom to switch schools without
      previous restrictions. When first introduced, the football transfer portal
      used to have two periods. The first transfer portal period happened in
      December, while the second happened in the Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system showed cracks.  In 2024-25, college football student athletes got a 20-day window to enter the portal in December and a 10-day window in April. Coaches have been very vocal about the negatives outweighing the positives of the spring portal window. The very few positives about the spring portal window is the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some contenders were able to get the final missing pieces for their upcoming season during the April portal window.  Sometimes those last few needs don't become obvious until a team goes through spring practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many players were able to earn big paydays in the most recent spring window simply because teams were desperate and eager to spend.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The negatives were the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Coaches, general managers and NIL collectives got tired of players signing deals in December and then asking for more money in April.</li>
        <li>With unlimited transfers, players have a ton of leverage in the spring.</li>
        <li>It's difficult to replace starters who leave at the end of April because top players can always get offered more money by someone else.</li>
        <li>Some coaches took advantage of the spring window to run off underperforming players and free up more scholarships.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, players were able to enter the transfer portal before their teams play in the bowl games.  In addition, when the 4-team playoff expanded to 12 teams, some players also entered the transfer portal before their respective teams played in the playoff.  It also has opened up criticism over players who transfer every year, and questions about whether unlimited transfers hurt players more than it benefits them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 2025, the spring portal was eliminated, while the winter transfer
      portal was moved from December to January 2 - 16, a 15-day transfer
      window. The transfer window exception granted to student football players
      after a new head coaching change was also reformed. Initially, student
      football athletes had a 30-day window to enter the transfer portal after a
      head coaching change. That has been reduced to a 15-day window.  There is also a 5-day transfer window for players on teams whose last postseason game is anytime on or after January 11.
    </p>
    <h2>Fixing the Transfer Portal</h2>
    <p>
      We do know is that college football is slowly trending towards the NFL. In
      the NFL, the new calendar year does not start until March due to the Super
      Bowl concluding in February. The NFL holds free-agency and their draft
      during the first two months of the off-season. NFL Teams would begin
      holding official team activities (OTAs) in May. However, in college,
      Spring practices happen in late-February/early March. The free agency
      period would happen in January/February.
    </p>

      Looking back at the playoff schedule, how many times would the extra 5-day
      transfer portal window happen if we utilized my 32-team playoff schedule?
      Here is what we would see if the 5-day transfer period would have been
      enforced depending on the National Championship game date:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>New Year's Day Falls On</th>
          <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
          <th>Extra 5 Day Window</th>

      The NCAA recently has moved to modify the transfer portal periods to after the National Championship games in Men’s and Women’s basketball and Men’s Ice Hockey.  <b>It would definitely benefit the FBS if the 15-day transfer portal window starts concluding the CFP National Championship Game.</b>  If we want to do the same for the CFP, the transfer portal period would then have the following periods:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
          <th>Transfer Portal Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 8</td>
          <td>January 9 - 23</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 9</td>
          <td>January 10 - 24</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 10</td>
          <td>January 11 - 25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 11</td>
          <td>January 12 - 26</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 12</td>
          <td>January 13 - 27</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 13</td>
          <td>January 14 - 28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January 14</td>
          <td>January 15 - 29</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, we would still have the 15-day transfer portal window.  It may look like it may be too late to transfer into the Winter Quarter, Winter Trimester, or perhaps the Spring Semester.  However, if you look at the bright side, certain courses within semesters are split into sessions (aka half-semesters/trimesters).   For student athletes that transfer when it’s too late to register for courses, they can use this portal period to transfer for the second half of a trimester or semester.  For universities that do split their calendar years into quarters, transferring to another university that enforces quarters would not be out of the realm.  
    </p>
    <h2>The Unlimited Transfer Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most contentious issue with the current transfer portal is the elimination of transfer restrictions. Under the current rules, players can transfer an unlimited number of times without sitting out a year. While this provides player freedom, it has created significant problems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Annual "free agency" undermines roster stability:</b> Teams can lose entire position groups in a single transfer window</li>
      <li><b>NIL leverage spirals:</b> Players can use the threat of transferring to negotiate higher NIL deals annually</li>
      <li><b>Competitive imbalance accelerates:</b> Wealthy programs can simply buy proven talent from smaller schools rather than developing players</li>
      <li><b>Academic concerns intensify:</b> Students transferring multiple times struggle to complete degrees, particularly in majors with sequential requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Several potential solutions have been proposed, though each has drawbacks:
    </p>

    <h3>Option 1: Reinstate the One-Time Transfer Rule with Graduate Exception</h3>
    <p>
      Return to allowing one penalty-free transfer, with additional transfers requiring sitting out one year unless transferring as a graduate with eligibility remaining. This was the pre-2021 model.
    </p>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b> Provides player freedom while discouraging serial transferring; maintains roster stability; preserves development culture</p>
    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> May face legal challenges on restraint of trade grounds; doesn't account for coaching changes or other legitimate reasons for multiple transfers</p>

    <h3>Option 2: Transfer Windows with Diminishing Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
      Allow unlimited transfers but reduce remaining eligibility by one year for each transfer beyond the first. For example, a player who transfers twice would have only three years of eligibility remaining instead of four.
    </p>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b> Creates natural deterrent against frivolous transfers; maintains player freedom; avoids legal challenges</p>
    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Punishes players for legitimate transfers (coaching changes, family emergencies); may be seen as coercive</p>

    <h3>Option 3: Institutional Caps on Transfer Intake</h3>
    <p>
      Limit how many transfers any single program can accept per year (e.g., maximum 10 incoming transfers annually). This doesn't restrict player movement but prevents teams from building entire rosters through the portal.
    </p>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b> Maintains player freedom; reduces "transfer portal recruiting wars"; encourages high school recruiting and development</p>
    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Could leave quality players without landing spots if all programs hit their caps; may disadvantage programs recovering from sanctions or coaching changes</p>

    <h3>The Recommended Approach</h3>
    <p>
      <b>This proposal takes no definitive stance on unlimited transfers vs. restrictions.</b> The transfer portal policy is complex, involving competing interests of player freedom, academic integrity, competitive balance, and legal compliance. What matters most for a 32-team playoff is that the transfer portal window occurs <i>after</i> the championship game, ensuring that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Players on playoff teams aren't distracted during championship runs</li>
      <li>Coaches can focus on their teams rather than recruiting during the playoffs</li>
      <li>The transfer window doesn't interfere with playoff preparation and execution</li>
      <li>All teams have equal access to transfer recruiting once the season concludes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The NCAA, conferences, and potentially Congress will need to determine the appropriate balance on transfer frequency limits. Whatever policy emerges, timing the portal after the championship resolves the immediate conflict between transfers and postseason competition.
