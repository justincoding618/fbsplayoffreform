    <h1>Recruiting Impact</h1>
    <p>
      The potential most frequent questions would ask the following: 
      <ul>
        <li>Does this affect coaches and recruits arranging Fall off-campus visits? </li>
        <li>How about post-playoff contact period in January and/or early February? </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The NCAA recently approved an early signing period in football.  Currently, the early signing period is a 3-day period, which begins on Wednesday before the conference championship games, as well as implementing a Summer early signing period so recruits can decide to either sign their NLI (National Letter of Intent) or wait until the current normal signing period. While players signing early sounds like a great idea, as mentioned earlier, it also encourages coaches to leave their teams much earlier before playing in their bowl game.  In addition, coaches will have to balance bowl and/or playoff preparations and recruiting due to the early signing period.  That is not an ideal situation for any involved teams, as teams will have to move quickly to find their successor and put together a good recruiting class.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The non-football sports do their signing period a bit differently.   Division I basketball has a one-week early signing period that happens during the first two weeks of the season.  Their regular signing period happens during the offseason and lasts only for four weeks.  All other Division I Athletics have a 10-month signing period from November until August.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NCAA made some recent changes to the FBS recruiting and transfer period.  Firstly, they decided that from September up until November, there will only be a quiet period.  Then, after the dead period on the week after Thanksgiving, there would be a two-week quiet period followed by a Holiday dead period. Having a quiet period only during the regular season definitely resolves the issues of stress of traveling to recruits’ hometowns while holding practices.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Recruiting Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff creates three primary recruiting challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Early Signing Period Timing:</b> Current early signing periods conflict with playoff preparation for 32 teams instead of just 12</li>
      <li><b>Contact Period Conflicts:</b> Coaches in deep playoff runs need time to recruit without juggling championship preparation</li>
      <li><b>National Signing Day Flexibility:</b> Ensuring adequate time for recruiting after the championship concludes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these challenges has workable solutions that maintain recruiting fairness while accommodating an expanded playoff.
    </p>
    <h2>The Current Recruiting Dilemma</h2>
    <p>
      The early signing period is another big obstacle to getting a 32-team
      playoff field to work. This new signing period was first implemented in
      2017. Up until 2023, the early signing period happens just before or after
      the third weekend of December and lasts for three days. The December
      signing period from 2017-23 looks like the following depending on the
      dates:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Date of 3rd Saturday of December</th>
          <th>Early Signing Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 15</td>
          <td>Dec. 19 - 21</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 16</td>
          <td>Dec. 20 - 22</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 17</td>
          <td>Dec. 21 - 23</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 18</td>
          <td>Dec. 15 - 17</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 19</td>
          <td>Dec. 16 - 18</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 20</td>
          <td>Dec. 17 - 19</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 21</td>
          <td>Dec. 18 - 20</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you notice a pattern here, the December signing period was held from the third Wednesday of December to the third or the fourth Friday of December.  However, they always happen before Christmas Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FBS recently moved up the early signing period.  Instead of signing in mid-December, the early signing period will now happen after Thanksgiving weekend.  The three-day signing period would begin on the Wednesday after Thanksgiving and go until the day of the first few conference championship games on Friday.  The new winter signing period looks like the following depending on the date of Wednesday after Thanksgiving:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Date of Wednesday After Thanksgiving</th>
          <th>Early Signing Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 28</td>
          <td>Nov. 28 - 30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 29</td>
          <td>Nov. 29 - Dec. 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 30</td>
          <td>Nov. 30 - Dec. 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 1</td>
          <td>Dec. 1 - 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 2</td>
          <td>Dec. 2 - 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 3</td>
          <td>Dec. 3 - 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dec. 4</td>
          <td>Dec. 4 - 6</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      The new pattern of the early signing period now goes from late-November to early December.  However, they always happen before Christmas Eve.  By implementing an expanded field, coaches from different teams might lose more days on closing in on their targeted prospects to commit and/or sign to play with them.  While we may need to begin the regular season early to compensate for the potential open postseason week for Fall recruiting, we can still implement a possible immense playoff field while putting in a period to let the coaches be able to contact and to check in on their target prospects.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The NCAA recently introduced a new 4-week contact period that only happens in January.  Currently, depending on the New Year’s Day of the Week, the 4-week contact period in January looks like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>New Year's Day Falls On</th>
          <th>Contact Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sunday</td>
          <td>Jan 3 - 28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Monday</td>
          <td>Jan. 8 - Feb. 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tuesday</td>
          <td>Jan. 7 - Feb. 2 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wednesday</td>
          <td>Jan. 6 - Feb. 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Thursday</td>
          <td>Jan. 5 - 31</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Friday</td>
          <td>Jan. 4 - 30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saturday</td>
          <td>Jan. 3 - 29</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, there is a 3-day dead period in the middle of January as well.  This is where they would be located:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>New Year's Day Falls On</th>
          <th>Contact Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sunday</td>
          <td>Jan 9 - 12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Monday</td>
          <td>Jan. 15 - 17</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tuesday</td>
          <td>Jan. 14 - 16</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wednesday</td>
          <td>Jan. 13 - 15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Thursday</td>
          <td>Jan. 12 - 14</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Friday</td>
          <td>Jan. 11 - 13</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saturday</td>
          <td>Jan. 10 - 12</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we also have to consider the National Signing Day as well.  Currently, the National Signing Day is on the first Wednesday of February.  The current National signing period looks like the following depending on the dates:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Date of Last Saturday of January</th>
          <th>National Signing Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 25</td>
          <td>Feb. 5 - Apr. 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 26</td>
          <td>Feb. 6 - Apr. 6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 27</td>
          <td>Feb. 7 - Apr. 7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 28</td>
          <td>Feb. 1 - Apr. 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 29</td>
          <td>Feb. 2 - Apr. 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 30</td>
          <td>Feb. 3 - Apr. 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jan. 31</td>
          <td>Feb. 4 - Apr. 4</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Signing Period would last for two months.  Players who did not sign during the December period would be able to sign their letter of intent during the two-month period.   When the year is not a leap year, the National Signing Day ends on the First Saturday of April.  When the year is indeed a leap year, the National Signing Day ends on the First Sunday of April.  The biggest question would come down to whether we would be flexible in moving the National Signing Day period, and still have it last for two months. The beginning of National Signing Day is still going to stay on the first Wednesday of February.
    </p>
    <h2>The Proposed Recruiting Solution</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The ideal solution is to eliminate the early signing period entirely.</b> The early signing period was introduced in 2017 to reduce recruiting pressure, but it has had unintended consequences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coaches leave for new jobs before bowl/playoff games to preserve recruiting classes</li>
      <li>Players commit before seeing how coaching changes affect their fit</li>
      <li>Teams in playoff contention face recruiting disadvantages vs. eliminated teams</li>
      <li>High school players feel rushed to make life-changing decisions before seeing how their senior seasons conclude</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Returning to a single signing period in February—after all bowl games and playoffs conclude—would resolve these issues. However, if the early signing period is retained due to pressure from coaches and programs, moving it to before Thanksgiving (as shown in the table below) minimizes conflicts with playoff preparation.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Thanksgiving Date</th>
          <th>Early Signing Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 22</td>
          <td>Nov. 19 - 21</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 23</td>
          <td>Nov. 20 - 22</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 24</td>
          <td>Nov. 21 - 23</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 25</td>
          <td>Nov. 22 - 24</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 26</td>
          <td>Nov. 23 - 25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 27</td>
          <td>Nov. 24 - 26</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nov. 28</td>
          <td>Nov. 25 - 27</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>As you can see, since the regular season would end on the weekend before Thanksgiving, the early signing period would be moved up by one week.  In addition, it would end one day before Thanksgiving.  If there is no school on Wednesday before Thanksgiving, signing day would be done virtually.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there would only be two teams remaining after the semifinals, the contact period would be fine.  Because the semifinals would happen on January 1 or 2 instead, many of the teams would not need to worry about juggling between contacting recruits and administering postseason practices.   However, I think it would benefit pushing the Winter Contact Period down by one week (to also give National Champions and National Runner Up enough time to recruit).  The three-day dead period would be eliminated.  It would look something like this:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>New Year's Day Falls On</th>
          <th>Contact Period</th>
          <th>National Signing Period</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sunday</td>
          <td>Jan. 9 - Feb. 4</td>
          <td>Feb. 8 - Apr. 8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Monday</td>
          <td>Jan. 15 - Feb. 10</td>
          <td>Feb. 14 - Apr. 14</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tuesday</td>
          <td>Jan. 14 - Feb. 9</td>
          <td>Feb. 13 - Apr. 13</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wednesday</td>
          <td>Jan. 13 - Feb. 8</td>
          <td>Feb. 12 - Apr. 12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Thursday</td>
          <td>Jan. 12 - Feb. 7</td>
          <td>Feb. 11 - Apr. 11</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Friday</td>
          <td>Jan. 11 - Feb. 6</td>
          <td>Feb. 10 - Apr. 10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saturday</td>
          <td>Jan. 10 - Feb. 5</td>
          <td>Feb. 9 - Apr. 9</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff's impact on recruiting is manageable with thoughtful adjustments to existing calendars. By either eliminating the early signing period or moving it to before Thanksgiving, by shifting the contact period to after the national championship game, and by extending the National Signing Period slightly, we preserve fair recruiting access for all programs while accommodating an expanded playoff. The key principle is to make the recruiting periods follow the conclusion of postseason play, not compete with it. This ensures that coaches can focus on their teams during championship runs and that all programs, whether eliminated early or playing deep into January, have equal opportunities to build their recruiting classes. These adjustments require only minor calendar shifts from current practice, making them easily implementable alongside playoff expansion.
