      <h1>Head Coaching Changes</h1>
      <p>
        Coaches leaving early is another pitfall to install an expanded playoff
        field. Even before the NCAA approved the Early Football Signing Period,
        some coaches have already decided to leave their current places and
        relocate to a “better” opportunity before the bowl games. When coaches
        do accept the opportunity in December, the recruiting dead period comes
        around and goes until January. In addition, the recruiting period prior
        to the Holiday dead period becomes an extremely stressful time for all
        coaching staffs involved to close out recruits and to get them to sign
        post-Thanksgiving, which would complete most or almost their recruiting
        class for the next season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, teams can call coaches and assistant coaches before or after
        the conclusion of the regular season and before the bowl games.
        Eventually, some will accept the position and leave their teams prior to
        their bowl game. Regardless of the proposed formats, having the 32-Team
        Playoff would completely bridge the gap between regular seasons and
        postseasons. It will also prevent coaches from agreeing to coach the new
        team too early.
      </p>
      <h2>Proposed Solution for Coaching Changes</h2>
      <p>
        What I think should happen for the FBS is to implement a similar
        coaching change rule in the NFL. The rules should be the following,
        regardless of the proposed FBS playoff format:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If teams decide to fire their head coach before postseason begins,
          colleges/universities must fire him any time before or after the
          regular season concludes and no later than the start of the
          postseason, unless teams miss the postseason.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams can interview any coaches who are not in any postseason, not in
          coaching, or have made the postseason. However, they must request
          permission from the college/university if a coach is under contract
          with that said team.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any teams' coaching staff loses within the playoffs, the coach and
          any assistant coaches can interview with any team that goes through
          the proper procedure to secure an interview. However, the interview
          must occur between when the team loses and when the bowl game kicks
          off.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any teams' coaching staff wins and advances to the second round,
          the team must require permission to interview the head coach and any
          assistant coaches from that said playoff team, which will have to
          happen before the second-round games kickoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any teams' coaching staff wins and advances beyond the second
          round, the team must require permission to interview the head coach
          and any assistant coaches from that said playoff team, which will have
          to transpire between the last and next postseason kickoff dates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Usually, the team will only allow interviewing the candidate once.
          However, if any teams' coaching staff wins advances to the National
          Championship Game, teams can schedule a 2nd interview, but must
          require permission from that championship-bound team. Once his team
          arrives at the national championship game site, teams will not be able
          to interview the candidate.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any coaching staff that are part of the playoff teams decide to
          accept new head coaching positions to any team, then that said coach
          can accept the offer, but must stay with his current team until their
          postseason run is over (this includes the season-ending bowl game).
