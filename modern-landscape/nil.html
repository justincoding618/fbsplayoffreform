    <h1>Name, Image, and Likeness</h1>
    <p>
      Prior to beginning the 2021 FBS season, major changes arrived in the
      collegiate athletic landscape. One big major change is that student
      athletes and universities can now profit off their name, image, and
      likeness (NIL). Student athletes can now sign endorsement deals and profit
      from other sponsors. Universities can also sign endorsement deals to
      sponsors as well in order to help other student athletes take advantage to
      the new NIL rules and to profit off their athletic brands as well.
      However, the structure of NIL is too loose as boosters can take advantage
      and can offer as much money to an athlete to get the player to commit to
      and to play for a certain university. This can also apply to offering
      money for players to transfer to that university. Boosters have formed
      collectives for their respective universities in order to support and to
      protect players as they seek opportunities in NIL. Some universities have
      more than one booster collective. If schools are unable to provide money
      to pay for student athletes, they could potentially fall behind the other
      schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      As more boosters take advantage with the currently half-baked NIL rules,
      there will be colleges fielding great teams through NIL. As NIL becomes
      more prominent in recruiting, certain boosters of universities already
      take advantage getting recruits to commit and to sign to their school. By
      boosters gaining the recruits the school wants on the team, schools can
      potentially get the player they wish in order to contend for a National
      Championship. As of now, the NIL rules are either too loose or they are
      not established very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be brutally honest, the NIL rules are extremely likely both too loose
      and not established very well. This led to boosters of some universities
      acquiring head starts on taking advantage of the half-baked NIL rules.
      Currently, at least 25 states have established NIL rules within their
      state. However, it is not enough for NIL to be truly regulated to the
      point where student athletes can profit without getting in trouble.
    </p>
    <h2>Recent NIL Developments</h2>
    <p>
      On June 6, 2025, the House vs NCAA settlement was approved. This paved the
      way with the formation of the College Sports Commission. The new
      organization would have a final say on doling out punishments and deciding
      on when rules have been broken. In addition, they’ll be in charge of rules
      around revenue sharing, student-athlete third-party name, image, and
      likeness deals, and roster limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      NIL Go would be a new implemented system to examine NIL deals. This system
      would verify whether deals between athletes and booster or associate
      entities are for valid business purposes rather than recruiting
      incentives. The system would ensure that that student athletes’ NIL deals
      comply within the rules. The deals must be resolved no more than 45 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a university, academics can play a role with how well you can do off the field.  Even with the new NIL Go system in place, the following questions are still left unanswered:
      <ul>
        <li>Would NIL be able to provide incentive for student athletes to do well in courses to keep their NIL deals? </li>
        <li>How about getting the team into the playoffs and making a deep playoff run? </li>
        <li>Could there be a way to regulate NIL the correct way and teams would still be able to contend for a National Championship while keeping the students in check to make sure they are doing well in classes?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The current NIL landscape is disorganized (to put it lightly).  Recruiting and transferring in terms of NIL are whole different complications.  Boosters and their collectives are still going to be a factor as they have opportunities for recruits.  What I do believe, however, is that it can be standardized nationally and managed correctly.  
    </p>
    <h2>How NIL Can Be Managed Correctly</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <b>DISCLAIMER: The following represents my proposed framework for how NIL should be managed, not a description of current policy. I am not an NIL expert, and my recommendations intentionally depart from how the current system operates in order to address its fundamental flaws.</b>
    </div>
    <p>
      How should NIL be handled?  The first thing we should do is to have a new set of rules in terms of the relationship between NIL and potential recruits.  The first major national rules I would propose in terms of recruiting high school players in relation to NIL are the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Universities can still offer scholarships to recruits</li>
        <li>Recruits can still schedule official visits, but only one per university</li>
        <li>Boosters and collectives can discuss, but cannot permit NIL offers to all unsigned recruits</li>
        <li>NIL opportunities can only be presented AFTER the recruit has committed AND signed their letter of intent to attend said university.</li>
        <li>After enrolling to said school, recruits will get their starting base NIL offers</li>
        <li>Boosters are still allowed to donate to collectives and universities to help provide enrolled student athletes NIL offers</li>
        <li>Extra Improper Benefits are not allowed under any circumstances</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of the relationship between the transfer portal and NIL, that is about a similar occurrence. The next major rules I would propose for transfers are the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Players must enter the transfer portal before the respective deadlines</li>
        <li>Transfers can only schedule official visits after entering the transfer portal, but only one per university</li>
        <li>Boosters and collectives from other universities cannot discuss nor offer NIL opportunities to players who are not in the transfer portal</li>
        <li>Boosters and collectives from other universities can discuss, but cannot offer NIL opportunities to players who enter the transfer portal AND have not yet signed with any university</li>
        <li>NIL offers can only be finalized AFTER a player has officially enrolled at the new university</li>
        <li>Extra Improper Benefits are not allowed under any circumstances</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> These NIL transfer rules are designed to work regardless of whether college football maintains unlimited transfers or reinstates transfer restrictions. The key principle is timing—NIL offers should follow enrollment, not precede it. This prevents NIL from being used as a recruiting inducement while still allowing players to understand general NIL opportunities at prospective schools. See the Transfer Portal Adjustments page for detailed discussion of potential transfer frequency limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      After enrolling in said university (whether as a freshman or as a transfer), it is strongly recommended for student athletes to meet with their compliance officers first before going through their NIL deal.  If they do not, the student athletes could lose their eligibility to play for their sport because of the faulty NIL deal.  In addition, it will get universities and anyone who extended the deal to said student athlete into deep trouble.  Everyone involved with NIL deals must make sure the deal is legitimate or they would face consequences.  
    </p>
    <h2>NIL's Critical Factors to Consider</h2>
    <p>
      So why are these critical?  NIL is becoming a priority for recruits to commit and to sign with said universities.  It is the same for transfers.  Both rules are flexible to where NIL discussions are allowed, but not to a point where offering NIL deals to unsigned recruits and non-transfers can become dangerous.  It is ok to discuss NIL opportunities so recruits and transfers can keep their options open.  However, offering NIL opportunities to recruits to get them to commit and to attend their universities and to current student athletes on other teams to transfer is risky and should be strongly inadvisable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While presenting NIL offers right off the bat can look advantageous, it can also look like spoiling said recruits.  Spoiling them can be bad because their behavior would then eventually become nearly difficult to control.  Furthermore, you would then be concerned about the off-the-field antics.  If you spoil them and do not make the right moves to keep them accountable, they will eventually lack the life skills needed to handle adulthood.  In addition, staff members and boosters failing to keep them accountable can also get themselves in trouble as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presenting NIL offers with extra improper benefits is another problem.  For example, boosters or staff members could provide free or discounted merchandise to student athletes alongside NIL.  In addition, they could also provide free or reduced cost of room and board as part of the NIL deal.  However, those are not allowed.  Every student athlete, staff members, and boosters must avoid being involved with extra improper benefits.  Niagara University has a set guideline for student athletes to avoid being involved with extra improper benefits.  Their guidelines are the following and should apply to every university:
      <ul>
        <li>A student-athlete cannot accept anything from an employee of NU or a Niagara athletics booster (e.g., use of a car, haircut, clothing, gifts, money, tickets for any kind of entertainment, payment of long-distance telephone calls).</li>
        <li>A student-athlete cannot accept free or reduced cost room and/or board from any NU employee or booster of NU’s athletics programs. This includes Lewiston, in the student-athlete’s home city or in any other location.</li>
        <li>A student-athlete cannot accept free or reduced merchandise or services from any merchant unless that free or reduced costs item is also available to the general public.</li>
        <li>A student-athlete cannot eat at a restaurant as the guest of an athletic booster or any employee of NU.</li>
        <li>On infrequent special occasions (e.g., a birthday, Thanksgiving, etc.) a student-athlete may accept an invitation to the home of an employee of NU or an athletic booster for a meal.</li>
        <li>A student-athlete cannot use a Department of Athletics copy machine, fax machine, or make a long-distance telephone call using department equipment or the long-distance access code of an employee of NU or athletic booster, unless it is for academic purposes and approved through the athletic compliance or academic services office.</li>
        <li>Members of the Department of Athletics staff or an athletic booster are not permitted to type reports, papers, letters, etc., for a student-athlete.</li>
        <li>A student-athlete cannot receive a special discount, payment arrangement, or credit on a purchase (e.g., airline ticket, clothing), or service (e.g., laundry, dry cleaning) from an employee of NU or an athletic booster.</li>
        <li>A NU employee or booster cannot provide a student-athlete with a loan of money, a guarantee of bond, the use of an automobile or the signing or the co-signing of a note to arrange a loan.</li>
        <li>A NU employee may provide a student-athlete only reasonable and occasional local (i.e., within the Lewiston/Niagara Falls/Buffalo area) transportation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      They also have a guideline for the staff members and boosters as well.  Those guidelines should also apply to every university as well.  Staff members and boosters need to be held accountable in order for them to also avoid giving student athletes improper extra benefits.  The only exception is if there is already a preexisting relationship between the booster and student-athlete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing them improper extra benefits is an NCAA violation.  If universities are caught doing them, they will face major consequences.  The punishments can include sanctions, reduced scholarship counts, condensed recruiting visits, vacated wins of games of involved participating players who gained improper extra benefits, and postseason bans.  Boosters will also face sanctions as well.  If they are involved with providing improper extra benefits as well, sanctions can include being disassociated from said universities.  For staff members of said universities, coaches would face show-cause penalties, and they and other staff members could face termination of employment if they are found to be involved in wrongdoing of improper extra benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one common trait between recruiting and the NFL Draft.  They are both crapshoots.  There are those who will hype up a recruit as the next herald star in the making.  While a player can be godly in High School, they could eventually become a bust in college and not make the NFL or be that promised star in college but bust out of the NFL.  We should not assume that their skills will translate into college and eventually up to the NFL.  While having the talent would help with succeeding in the college level, work ethic on and off the field is important too in order for players to succeed at the collegiate level and continuing and improving their work ethic in the NFL.

      Out of the #1 high school recruits who were drafted in the first round, three made at least one Pro Bowl and two more won a Super Bowl.  In addition, only two #1 rated High School players were drafted #1 overall in the NFL Draft.  However, it is too early to call for the #1 High School recruits in 2021-2022 since they were drafted recently.  The other two #1 High School recruits were also drafted but did not carve out an NFL career.  One more went undrafted and did not make it to the NFL.  This is why NIL offers should not be passed to unsigned recruits nor those who have not entered the transfer portal. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For all enrolled players, their starting NIL base will only increase for the next season if they have played at least 30-65% of snaps during each season.  So why 30-65% of snaps?  In one article, NFL teams give bonuses to their players if they are able to meet certain criteria (the Chiefs, for example, incentivize a player if they play 65% defensive snaps or more plus postseason accomplishments).   The following would be the potential increases of their base depending on the percentage of snaps participated:
      <ul>
        <li>Playing at least 30% but no more than 49% of snaps should be at least a 3% increase of their starting base for their next season.</li>
        <li>Playing at least 50% of snaps but no more than 64% should be at least a 5% increase of their starting base for their next season. </li>
        <li>Playing at least 65% of snaps should have at least a 10% increase of their starting base for their next season.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for a transferring player to prove his worth for another team, participating in a lot of snaps is crucial.  If a player plays less than the said number of snaps, they would remain unproven.  However, you can see potential, but you’d take a gamble on them hoping their potential can shine with another said team. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the postseason, we can give bonuses to players for making it to the conference title game, with a bonus of winning the conference championship.  Another bonus can be distributed for each player if their team makes the championship postseason (whether as an automatic or an at-large).  Additional bonuses can be made if teams are able to advance to certain rounds up until the National Championship game (so basically, up to four bonuses, with a possible fifth if a team wins the National Championship).  The more postseason games teams can advance, the more bonuses the teams will earn for their players and coaches.  
    </p>
    <p>
      For awards, we can offer better NIL opportunities for student athletes if they are named the following:
      <ul>
        <li>All-America Team</li>
        <li>Dean’s List (for all FBS Universities)</li>
        <li>First or Second Team Academic All-America</li>
        <li>First, Second, Third, or Honorable Mention Conference Team (for all FBS Conferences)</li>
        <li>Conference Academic All-America (for all FBS Conferences)</li>
        <li>Conference Individual Awards (for all FBS Conferences)</li>
        <li>Conference Championship MVP (for all FBS Conferences)</li>
        <li>Walter Camp Award Winner or Finalist</li>
        <li>Maxwell Award Winner or Finalist</li>
        <li>Heisman Winner or Finalist</li>
        <li>Overall MVP of at least one of the final three rounds</li>
        <li>Offensive MVP of at least one of the final three rounds</li>
        <li>Defensive MVP of at least one of the final three rounds</li>
        <li>Positional Reward Winners or Finalists for College Football Positions (Davey O’Brien, Rimington, Chuck Bednarik, Jim Thorpe, Fred Biletnikoff, etc.)</li>
        <li>Rewards within each team (such as Team MVP, Team Captain, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The more honors a player receives, the better NIL opportunities said player will be able to gain in order to continue his college football career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of all of this as a salary raise plus potential bonuses for each year in your job.  If your performance review is at least good, you get a bonus and potentially at least a raise in salary.  The percentage of snaps would apply the same thing as a salary raise.  The rewards and honors would function like bonuses to your salary.
