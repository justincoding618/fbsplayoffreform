        In all NCAA Divisions, no college team will play every team. A 12-game
        regular season schedule or any length of the regular season and possible
        conference championship games plus any length of the playoffs are not
        enough to play all teams. The regular seasons in Division I FCS, Division II, and Division III and their current playoff
        formats are also not enough to play every team. If all teams can play
        every team, the schedule would end up as a regular season lasting
        multiple years, which is impossible for all teams. We are going to take
        a look at the different divisions and how they do their regular seasons and postseasons.
      </p>
      <h2>Division I FCS</h2>
      <p>
        Division I FCS (formerly Division I-AA) is very similar to Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A). However, no
        conferences, except the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), enforce
        a championship game and do not split teams into divisions. The FCS
        division only started with 41 football teams as part of either in one of
        five different conferences or as FCS Independents splitting from the FBS
        division. It eventually expanded to 129 teams as more conferences and
        teams joined the FCS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially from 1978-2025, each team plays an 11-game regular season
        while the duration of the regular season lasts from 12-14 weeks. From
        2008-25, FCS teams only played a 12-game regular season schedule if
        there were 14 Saturdays from Labor Day Weekend to Thanksgiving Weekend.
        The season duration would look like the this:
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Number of Games</th>
          <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
          <th>Opening Weekend</th>
          <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="2">11</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Weekend of Sept. 1-5</td>
          <td rowspan="3">Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Weekend of Aug. 23-31</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>12</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
      Beginning in 2026, all FCS teams play a 12-game regular season schedule every year (except the Ivy League as each team plays a 10-game schedule every year).  It would begin on the weekend before Labor Day Weekend and conclude on the weekend before Thanksgiving.  The season duration would look like the this:
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Number of Games</th>
          <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
          <th>Opening Weekend</th>
          <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="2">12</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Weekend of Aug. 25-29</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>

      <p>
        From its inception and until 2024, the Ivy League did not send their
        conference champion nor any other teams to the postseason. On December
        18, 2024, after sitting out of the postseason for nearly 80 years, the
        Ivy League approved their teams to participate in the FCS playoffs
        beginning with the 2025 season.
      </p>
      <p>
        MEAC and SWAC only send their conference champions to the Celebration
        Bowl. MEAC teams are eligible for at-large bids for the FCS playoffs if
        they do not win the conference championship. The SWAC, on the other
        hand, do not send any team to the postseason other than the Celebration
        Bowl. The MEAC and SWAC are now the only conferences that do not send
        their conference champions to the FCS playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evolution of the Division I FCS Playoffs looked like the following:

      <p>
        Since splitting from Division I FBS, the FCS initiated a 4-team playoff in 1978.  The four-team playoff consisted of three regional selections (East, South, and West) and an at-large bid.  As more conferences and teams joined the FCS, the playoffs expanded.  It expanded to eight teams in 1981, then to 12 teams the following season, 16 teams in 1986, 20 teams in 2010, and eventually expanded to 24 teams starting in 2013.  The 2020 season was an exception to the rule due to the pandemic.  The FCS postponed their 2020 season to spring 2021 and held a 16-team playoff.  The 1981 edition of the playoffs contained automatic bids from the five conference champions, one bid from the top independent team, and two at-large bids.  The 12-team playoff seasons from 1982-1985 were a bit unique as there were some conferences that were hybrids of either Division I-A and I-AA or I-AA and DIvision II conferences.  Automatic qualifiers went to teams that win their conference with at least 6 Division I -AA teams during the 12-team playoff seasons.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 1986-playoff expansion and before the 2013-playoff expansion, not all FCS conferences have automatic bids to the playoffs.  Before the latest FCS playoff expansion, teams that were part of the non-automatic qualifying conferences did not offer football scholarships and must meet a requirement in order to gain consideration for the playoffs.  These teams must have at least eight wins in Division I in order to gain consideration into the playoffs.  However, there were exceptions to the case.  Until 1997, the Patriot League abstained from the playoffs.  Some teams that win the conference championships from these non-automatic qualifying conferences also met the winning requirement but did not earn any playoff invite.  Because these conferences do not have automatic bids, some of the conferences send teams to the bowl games to relinquish their season accomplishments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 2013 playoff expansion, all FCS conferences give scholarships to their respective players except for the Ivy League and Pioneer League.   Teams in either of those conferences do not offer scholarships.  All FCS conferences except for two receive automatic bids to the FCS playoffs. In order to qualify for the playoffs, teams must win their conference and break all ties if they share their conference championship.  With the Ivy League’s inclusion for the FCS playoffs, the FCS playoffs consist of 11 automatic bids and 13 at-large selections to determine the Division I FCS National Champion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The current FCS playoffs since 2010 happens as follows:

        The FCS Playoffs last 6-7 weeks due to one or two bye weeks in-between the semifinals and National Championship games.  From 2013-23, all eight national seeds earn a first-round bye and play the winner of the first-round playoff games, which contain 16 unseeded teams.  Since the 2024 season, all eight national seeds earn a first-round bye and play the winner of the first-round playoff games, which contain 8 more national seeded teams and 8 more unseeded teams.  The 16 national seeds also earn home field advantage, with the higher seed hosting a playoff game, and top two teams earning home field throughout until the FCS National Championship Game.  The first top 8 national seed to win four Division I FCS playoff games or first top 16 national seed or unseeded team to win five Division I FCS playoff games is the Division I FCS National Champion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From 2008-25, when the FCS allowed teams to play a 12-game regular season, teams could play up to 16 or 17 games if they make the playoffs.  In the 2025 season, Illinois State became the first and only team to play 17 games (as well as the first team to win four true road postseason games) before the FCS permanently allowed 12-game regular season schedules.  The following are teams that pulled off this model with the 2008 NCAA rule from 2008-25:

        With the permanent regular season expansion to 12 games beginning in 2026, a top 8 national seed would permanently play up to 16 games, while a first-round participant would permanently play up to 17 games to try to become a Division I FCS National Champion.

      <h2>Division II</h2>
      <p>
        In Division II football, most teams play either a 10-game or an 11-game schedule.  Initially, their regular season kicks off in the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
            <th>Opening Weekend</th>
            <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>1</td>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        You'll notice how some Division II teams playing an 11-game schedule initially have zero bye weeks in the regular season (in most years).  In 2024, the NCAA allowed schools to play one week earlier, which extended the regular season from 11 weeks to 12 weeks.  However, the maximum number of regular season games still reamained at 11 games.  Their regular season kicks off in the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>

        Four Super Regions divide the Division II football conferences to one of four super regions.  Each super region houses four conferences each.  Northeastern State currently competes as an Independent.  Most Division II teams within their respective conferences do schedule non-conference opponents.  However, the number of non-conference games each Division II team can play highly depends on the max number of conference games they can play.  That number would also depend on the number of Division II teams that are part of their respective conferences.  The following are the number of conference games and nonconference games each Division II team can play, depending on the conference affiliation:

        In other words, any team that does not play any non-conference games play a conference-only schedule during the regular season.  However, the following Division II conferences are the exceptions:

        You'll notice that teams in either of those conferences play a non-conference schedule and a pre-set conference schedule.  The PSAC teams play all their divisional opponents, with four or five non-conference games.  Each also play conference championship games to determine their conference champion.  NISC play a 10-game conference schedule plus one non-conference game.  The NSIC names division champions as well as their conference champion, but does not hold a conference championship game.  SIAA teams play an 8-game conference schedule plus 2 or 3 non-conference games.  The top two teams in the conference standings would participate in the conference championship game.   Since 2024, the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association has gone division-less.  Each team plays an 8-game conference schedule plus 2 non-conference games.  The top two teams in the conference standings would participate in the conference championship game.

        In 1964, the NCAA utilized four bowl games to highlight the best Division II teams after the regular season.  Division II relied on polls to consent a National Champion.  Therefore, these bowl games did not matter and did not affect the standing of the participating Division II teams.  This happened from 1964-72.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Division II began to administer a playoff system in 1973.  The evolution of the Division II Playoffs looked like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Year</th>
            <th>Playoff Field</th>

            <td>32</td>

      </p>
      <p>
        Starting in 1973, the NCAA administered an 8-team playoff system to determine a national champion in Division II Football.  After 15 seasons, it then expanded to 16 teams in 1988.  The playoff then expanded to a fifth round to 24 teams in 2004, and eventually expanded to 28 teams, which lasted from 2015-24.  Their playoffs consist of four super regional playoffs, semifinals, and a national championship game.  
      </p>
      <p>
        From 2015-18, the top seven seeds in each regional ranking advance to the Division II football playoffs.  The four number one seeds in each super region will gain a first-round bye, while the other six seeded teams in each super region will play against each other in the first round.  From 2019-24, only the top four teams in each super region have seeds, with the number one seed still gaining a first-round bye, while the last three qualifying teams in each super region are unseeded and play on the road against one of the top four seeds.  The national quarterfinals are the Super Region championships.  The Division II selection committee reseeds the four super regional winners, seeding them from 1-4, and one of those four super regional winners will win the championship.  The first number one seed to win four postseason games (playing up to 15 total games) or any 2-4 seeds or unseeded teams (2-7 seeds from 2015-18 Division II Playoff Editions) to win five postseason games (playing up to 16 total games) will win the championship. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Up until the 2024 season, winning a conference championship does not guarantee an automatic spot into the Division II playoffs.  In other words, Division II football had no automatic qualifiers.  Every team in one of the Division II super regions can qualify for the playoffs.  The NCAA Division II football national committee provides three Super Regional rankings of each of the four Super Regions over the final three weeks of the season.  The Super Regional rankings show the top 10 teams from each super region to keep track of teams in contention to make the Division II playoffs for the final three weeks of the regular season.  From 2015-24, the Division II selection committee will then select the top seven teams in each super region to make the playoffs, totaling to the final 28 teams to play for the Division II Football Championship.  Because there were no automatic bids, it is possible for a conference to not have a team qualify for the playoffs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there was a rule in place called Earned Access.  Earned Access works for each super region.  It will reward the final spot in the seven-team regional bracket to the highest ranked team from a conference if said team is in the top 9 of their respective regional rankings, but not in the top 7. For example, if the highest ranked team from a conference is 8th in the final regional rankings, it would be awarded the final invitation in that region. If the highest ranked team from a conference is 10th or lower, that conference will not be represented in the playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On January 17, 2025, Division II eliminated the Earned Access Model and administers automatic bids beginning with the 2025 season.  The automatic bids will go to the teams who won their conference championship.  If a conference names co-champions, ties would be broken to determine their automatic bid.  With the administration of automatic bids, the Earned Access Bids would be eliminated.  In addition, on April 23, 2025, Division II has officially expanded the playoff to 32 teams beginning the 2025 season to accommodate the automatic bids.  This time, the first team to win five postseason games (playing up to 16 total games) will win the championship.  The current Division II playoffs schedule goes as follows:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Playoff Round</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Division II currently offers three bowl games to teams that missed the Division II playoffs.  These bowl games have conference ties and kick off on the same weekend as the Division II playoff quarterfinals.
      </p>
      <h2>Division III</h2>
      <p>
        Division III football is almost the same scenario as Division II.  However, almost all teams only play a 10-game regular season schedule to accommodate their playoffs and bowl games. The season duration would look like the this:
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Number of Games</th>
          <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
          <th>Opening Weekend</th>
          <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Labor Day Weekend (Aug. 30-Sept. 5)</td>
          <td>Penultimate Weekend Before Thanksgiving (Nov. 10-16)</td>
        </tr>
      </table> 
      </p>  
      <p>
        The regular season begins on Labor Day Weekend and ends at the same time Division II concludes their regular season (also having a date range on November 10-16).  Like Division II, the number of conference games Division III teams can play depends on the number of teams that are part of their respective conferences.  Each conference supports at least 6 teams, but no more than 10-11 teams.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The following are the number of conference games and nonconference games each Division III team can play, depending on the conference affiliation and the number of teams that are part of their respective conferences:
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Number of Teams in Conference</th>
          <th>Number of Conference Games</th>
          <th>Number of Non-Conference Games</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7</td>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Division III conferences also do not split teams into divisions and do not enforce a Conference Championship Game, with the following few conferences making exceptions:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Division III Conference</th>

        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Up until 2025, the New England Small Collegiate Athletic Conference (NESCAC) did not send their conference champion nor any other teams to the postseason.  The 10 NESCAC teams initially played an 8-game conference only schedule.  Since 2017, all NESCAC members only play a 9-game round-robin conference only schedule.  On April 18, 2025, the NESCAC approved their teams to participate in the postseason beginning in 2026. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1969, the NCAA started utilizing regional championship games for small college football teams.  They utilized the Knute Rockne Bowl and Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl as the regional bowl games as their postseason.  This happened for only four seasons from 1969-72. In 1973, the NCAA began enforcing a playoff system in Division III.  The evolution of the Division III Playoffs looked like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>

        Division III kept the Stagg Bowl name and began using a 4-team playoff system in 1973.  It expanded to eight teams in 1975, then to 16 teams in 1985, 28 teams in 1999, and eventually expanded to 32 teams starting with the 2005 season.  The 32-team playoff lasted until the 2023 season.  The Division III playoffs from 1999-2023 ran as follows:

        Prior to playoff expansion, the Division III playoff schedule is nearly the same as the Division II playoffs except for the National Championship Game.  The Friday before the 3rd Weekend of December is the day of the Division III National Championship Game.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Division III football’s regular season is unique.  In order to qualify for the playoffs, teams must win their conference.  They also have to win all tiebreakers as well if they share their conference champion with at least one other team.  This is because at-large spots were very limited in the Division III playoffs.  You can learn more about this in <a href="/season-archives/playoff-access-history.html">the Historical Perspective of Playoff Access</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On April 18, 2024, the Division III Management Council supported (and eventually approved) the expansion of the Division III Playoffs to 40 teams. With the expansion gone to effect since the 2024 season, there would be now double-digit at-large berths for the Division III playoffs.  With the extra week added to the Division III playoff schedule, the Division III National Championship would kick off in January.  The Division III playoffs schedule would run as follows:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Playoff Round</th>

        In addition, Division III currently administers 14 bowl games to any team that did not win their conference championship and missed the playoffs.  Most Division III bowl games are part of a bowl series and have conference ties.  These bowl games kick off on the same weekend as the first round of the Division III playoffs.
