    <h1>2024-25 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2024 season was the first season of the 12-team CFP. It was also the first season the Pac-12 operated as a two-team conference (and does not determine a conference champion).  This season had some notable controversies.
      <ul>
        <li>The top four conference champions were given a first round bye.  This meant that any conference champion ranked outside of the top four would earn a first round bye.  Mountain West Champion Boise State (12-1) and Big 12 Champion Arizona State (11-2) were both given first round byes despite them being ranked outside the top four.</li>
        <li>In addition, Notre Dame and any FBS Independent would not earn a first round bye even if they produce an undefeated or 1-loss regular season.  For example, if Notre Dame went 12-0 or 11-1, they would be no higher than a 5th seed and cannot become a top four seed.</li>
        <li>Although Boise State gained respect publically, AAC Champion Army was undervalued by the CFP.  They were ranked 22nd due to their perceived weak schedule.  In addition, the CFP once again did not account the Army-Navy game as the final rankings always came out the Sunday after the conference championship games.  After winning the AAC, Army lost to Navy the next week.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>LSU (8-4)</td>
          <td>Duke (9-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Navy (9-3)</td>
          <td>Kansas St (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Texas A&M (8-4)</td>
          <td>Louisiana (10-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Texas Tech (8-4)</td>
          <td>Louisville (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      With 6 out of 9 conference champions ranked in the CFP Top 25, 19 out of the 23 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25. LSU, Navy, Texas A&M, and Texas Tech were the teams that have gotten the final at-large playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very difficult for me to justify leaving out two SEC teams from the playoff field.  Yes, Texas A&M and LSU picked up bad losses during the regular season.  Despite the bad loss to Auburn (5-7), Texas A&M went 2-2 against playoff-bound teams.  This was enough for them to overcome the bad loss and propel them as one of the last teams into the field.  LSU was a similar case as well, although the bad loss to Florida (7-5) is not as bad, they have a notable bad loss to USC (2-2).  Despite those two bad losses, LSU also went 2-2 against playoff-bound teams.  This was also enough for them to overcome the bad losses and propel them as one of the last teams into the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Texas Tech was treading dangerously to becoming one of the first teams out.  However, despite losing to fringe teams Baylor, Washington State, and TCU (all were 8-4), Texas Tech was able to pick up wins against both Big 12 Championship Game participants.  Texas Tech's record against playoff-bound teams (going 2-1) propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Navy's playoff support hinged on beating AAC Champion Army.  Heading into the Army-Navy week, Navy has a notable win against Memphis, but also lost to fellow fringe team Tulane (9-4) and has a bad loss to Rice (4-8).  By beating Army, their record against playoff bound teams would improve to 2-1 (with their notable win being Memphis and loss being against Notre Dame).  Navy was able to take care of business as defeating Army helped them gain the final at-large bid for the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke, Kansas State, Louisiana, and Louisville were among the first teams out. Louisiana's overall body of work was not enough to give them an at-large bid.  While winning at Wake Forest proved they can win against power conference teams, they have no wins against playoff bound teams.  They needed to win the Sun Belt to get into the playoff field.  However, they did not get it done against Marshall.  Duke went 0-2 against playoff-bound teams.  Picking up a bad loss to Georgia Tech (7-5) did not help their playoff case either, so those combined kept Duke out of the playoff field.  Louisville was just 1-3 against playoff bound teams.  They could not afford to pick up a bad loss, which they did against Stanford (3-9).  That bad loss combined with their bad record against playoff teams kept Louisville out of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kansas State is the final notable team that was among the first teams out.  Kansas State has picked up a win against playoff-bound Colorado (9-3).  While they had a nice win against fellow fringe team Tulane (9-4), they needed to pick up one more win to propel them to a playoff spot.  They could not get it done against Iowa State, dropping them to 1-3 against playoff-bound teams, and also picking up a bad loss to Houston (4-8)
    </p>
    <p>
      Baylor and TCU were among the next teams out.  While TCU picked up a notable win against Texas Tech (who barely made the playoff field), the two bad losses to Houston (4-8) and UCF (3-9) outweighed TCU's notable win vs Texas Tech.  Baylor's case was a hybrid between Kansas State and TCU. While Baylor also picked up a notable win against Texas Tech, their 1-3 record against playoff bound teams along with their bad loss to Utah (3-9) kept Baylor out of the playoff field.
