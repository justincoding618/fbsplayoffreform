    <h1>2025-26 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2025 season was the second season of the 12-team CFP.  The CFP began to go into straight seeding.  It is also the first season of C-USA rebranding to CUSA and AAC rebranding to the American Conference.  It was also the second and final season the Pac-12 operated as a two-team conference (and does not determine a conference champion) before relaunching. This season had a notable controversy.
      <ul>
        <li>The main controversy centered around Alabama, Miami (FL), and Notre Dame.</li>
        <li>Notre Dame was ranked ahead of Alabama and Miami (FL) for most of the season.  However, after Thanksgiving Weekend, Alabama jumped Notre Dame for the #9 spot.  It assured Alabama a spot in the CFP even if it lost in the SEC Championship Game.  Alabama was badly beaten by Georgia in the SEC Championship game, but was not penalized for losing, staying at #9 and clinching the second-to-last at-large spot.</li>
        <li>BYU lost as badly in the Big 12 Championship game to Texas Tech, but was dropped one spot to #12.  This led to a decision between Notre Dame and Miami (FL).  Had BYU won the Big 12 championship, Oregon would have likely clinched a first round bye despite not playing on Conference Championship Game weekend and the final two playoff spots would have came down to Texas Tech, Alabama, Notre Dame, and Miami (FL).</li>
        <li>Miami (FL) was eventually chosen by the committee for the final at-large spot, leaving Notre Dame out of the CFP completely.  Notre Dame decided to decline a bowl invitation after being snubbed for a CFP spot.  Miami (FL) went on a run to the National Championship game before losing to Big Ten Champion Indiana, the only undefeated team remaining.</li>
        <li>It became the first season where two non-power FBS conference champions made it into the 12-team field.  This led to at least some analysts and fans questioning whether non-power FBS teams should be included at all, arguing that their presence excluded power conference teams like Notre Dame and BYU from the playoff.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

          <td>South Florida (9-3)</td>

    <p>
      With 5 out of 9 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 20 out of the 23 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  North Texas would clinch one of the final four at-large spots in virtue of being ranked number 25 in the CFP rankings.  They led the NCAA in yards per game and points scored per game. Their only notable losses were to South Florida (who also made the field; more on this later) and to American Champion Tulane.  However, they do have a win against MAC Champion Western Michigan, which was how the committee put them at #25 in the CFP Rankings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final three spots went to Arizona State, Illinois, and South Florida.  Illinois had the best resume out of the three teams.  Despite their bad loss to Wisconsin (as well as losing to Washington), they went 3-2 against playoff bound teams.  Their notable wins are ACC Champion Duke, MAC Champion Western Michigan, and USC (who is the #16 seed in the 32-team field).  Arizona State was the only team to beat Big 12 Champion Texas Tech during the regular season.  They also picked up a win vs TCU (who is among the first four out).  Their bad loss to Mississippi State almost costed them a spot in the playoffs, but being the only team to beat the Big 12 Champion during the regular season was what propelled Arizona State to one of the last playoff spots despite going 1-3 against playoff bound teams.  Finally, South Florida was able to clinch the final playoff spot.  Their notable win was against Mountain West Champion Boise State.  They were 1-1 against playoff bound teams.  However, losses to fringe teams Navy and Memphis nearly dented their playoff hopes.  However, Boise State winning the Mountain West was enough to put South Florida as the last team into the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louisville, Navy, TCU, and Washington were among the first teams out.  TCU was very close to claiming a playoff spot.  However, while they have a great win against Houston, they were just 1-2 against playoff bound teams.  Their bad loss to Kansas State (6-6) as well as losing to fellow fringe team Iowa State (8-4) did not help them either. TCU's record against playoff-bound teams was not enough to overcome the bad loss to Kansas State and loss to Iowa State. Washington was nearly a similar case to TCU.  While their best win was against Illinois, they were just 1-3 against playoff bound teams.  However, this is also compounded with a bad loss to Wisconsin.  Washington's record against playoff-bound teams was not enough to overcome the bad loss to Wisconsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louisville was well on their way to a playoff spot. Their win against Miami (FL) was very notable.  However, after picking up a signature win against Miami (who is the #10 seed in the 32-team field), they lost three of their last four games in November (due to injuries on their team), picking up two bad losses against Cal (7-5) and Clemson (6-6) and losing to fellow fringe team SMU (8-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Navy's overall record was impressive.  Navy does not have any bad losses (abet they were both blowout losses).  However, while they were able to take care of business during the regular season, with South Florida being their most notable win, going 1-2 against playoff-bound competition has pushed them out of the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      SMU is the last notable team that I want to note.  They went from potentially making the playoff field to falling among the next teams out.  SMU's win against Miami (FL) at home was great.  However, they also lost to fellow fringe teams TCU and Wake Forest.  Their bad losses to Cal (7-5) and Baylor (5-7) dented their playoff hopes.  SMU's regular-season finale loss to Cal pushed them down as among the next teams out.
