      <h1>Season Archives</h1>
      <p>
        Below are the previous seasons of what the 32-team playoff would have
        looked like had it been administered. From 1990-97, the split National
        Championship happened three times in the last eight years. The BCS was
        introduced to truly pit the #1 and #2 teams in the country. The CFP
        replaced the BCS system and is the current system to determine the
        National Champion. However, all systems came with controversies. We
        start with the 1998 season because the BCS system was the first system
        to try to truly determine a National Champion. The 2020 season will
        still be looked; however, due to the ongoing pandemic that year, a
        32-team playoff may not have been possible (and that would be the only
        exception). It could have been temporaily downsized to a 16-team field
        (like the Spring 2021 Division I FCS Postseason) if the FBS were pressed
        for time.
