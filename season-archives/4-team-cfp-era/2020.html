      <h1>2020-21 FBS Playoffs</h1>
      <p>
        The 2020 season was the seventh season of the 4-team CFP. It was an exception where a 4-team College Football Playoff
        would have been a wise choice due to the unforeseen circumstances.
        Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, and Notre Dame were selected as the final
        four teams to play for the College Football Playoff National Championship.
        Under normal circumstances, this would be a 32-team field. However, given
        the pandemic's impact on scheduling and the uneven number of games played,
        a modified 16-team field would have been more appropriate for 2020,
        similar to how Division I FCS temporarily reduced their playoff from 24 to
        16 teams. However, I will demonstrate both a 16-team field and a 32-team
        field. The 32-team format would use the selection method as normal.
        However, the 16-team format would use a customized selection method. Overall
        Conference Champions ranked in the Top 25 would earn an automatic bid into
        the playoff field.  The rest would be filled with at-large bids.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
      </p>
      <h2>16-Team Field</h2>
      <p>
      <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
      <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games and are ranked in the Top 25.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      </p>
      <p>Ball State won the MAC and UAB won CUSA.  However, they were both not ranked in the final CFP Top 25, which eliminates them from playoff contention.  Coastal Carolina and Louisiana were named Sun-Belt Co-Champions as the Sun Belt Championship Game was cancelled and declared a no-contest.  Coastal Carolina would win the automatic bid by being ranked in the CFP Top 25 and having the head-to-head tie breaker over Louisiana.  Notre Dame temporarily played in the ACC for the 2020 season.  They lost the ACC Championship game to Clemson, leading Clemson to clinching the automatic bid by also being ranked in the CFP Top 25.</p>
      <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
      <p>
        With 8 automatic bids filled in, a combination of the final regular season CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      </table>
      </p>
      <p>With 8 of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, eight bids have been clinched.  There was enough at-large bids for eight more teams.  The top four ranked non-conference champions in the CFP were given the at-large bids, while the final four teams were merit-based selections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indiana, Iowa State, Louisiana, and Oklahoma State would claim the final playoff spots.   Indiana nearly beat Ohio State in Columbus.  However, their body of work (while playing a tougher Big Ten East Division) was enough to clinch one of the final playoff spots.  Iowa State picked up impressive wins vs  Oklahoma, Texas, and TCU.  This was enough to clinch one of the final playoff spots. Oklahoma State was able to pick up key wins vs Iowa State, but also has losses to Texas, Oklahoma, and TCU.  Their win vs Iowa State was enough to propel them for one of the last playoff spots. Finally, Louisiana picked up a key non-conference win vs Iowa State.  This was enough for them to be among the last teams in.
      </p>
      <p>
        BYU, Miami (FL), North Carolina, and Northwestern were among the first teams out.  North Carolina was able to pick up wins vs Miami (FL) and NC State, but it was not enough to claim a playoff spot as they also picked up bad losses to Virginia and Florida State.  Northwestern picked up a key win vs Iowa.  However, their bad loss to Michigan State as well as losing the Big Ten Championship kept them out of the playoff field.  Miami (FL) picked up an impressive win vs NC State, but their losses to Clemson and North Carolina prevented them from making the playoff field.  Finally, BYU could not pick up their only opportunity vs a playoff-bound team.  Their schedule was the easiest of the fringe teams, which kept them out of the playoff field.

      <h3>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h3>
      <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Last Teams In</th>
            <th>First Teams Out</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Army (9-2)</td>
            <td>Appalachian State (8-3)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Buffalo (5-1)</td>
            <td>Boise State (5-1)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stanford (4-2)</td>
            <td>Colorado (4-1)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>TCU (6-4)</td>
            <td>Marshall (7-2)</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>With 8 of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 17 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the five best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a very tricky season as not everyone played the same number of games.  The requirement that I made was that teams would need to play at least 5 games to be considered for a playoff spot.  Anything less than that and they won't be considered because there is not enough to determine whether the team would be worthy of a playoff spot.  For example, Washington only played 4 games during the regular season, so they sadly would not be considered for a playoff spot because they did not play enough games.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The first safe playoff spot would have gone to Liberty.  They claim one of the last safe playoff spots as their record against the ACC is impressive.  Liberty goes 10-1 vs ACC Teams, with their only loss to a one-point loss to NC State.  This in itself propelled them to a playoff spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final four spots went to TCU, Stanford, Buffalo, and Army.  TCU's overall body of work was the most impressive of the last teams in.  While their bad loss to Kansas State does stand out, their 2-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, with wins vs Texas and Oklahoma State was impressive enough to gain one of the playoff spots.  Stanford has a key win vs Washington, which propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.  Buffalo and Army both impressed enough given the circumstances to clinch one of the final playoff spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Appalachian State, Boise State, Colorado, and Marshall were among the first teams out.  Colorado does have a win vs Stanford, but there was not enough to consider them a playoff spot.  Boise State was so close to clinching the Mountain West Championship.  Their loss to San Jose State has placed them on the wrong-side of the fringe.  Marshall was on its way to a playoff spot.  However, they dropped the last two games of the season, which placed them among the first teams out.  Finally, Appalachian State did not have any wins vs playoff teams.  They were able to take care of business vs other teams, but their 0-2 record vs playoff-bound teams placed them among the first teams out.
