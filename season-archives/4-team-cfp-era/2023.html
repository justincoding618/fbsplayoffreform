    <h1>2023-24 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2023 season was the tenth and final season of the 4-team CFP. This season was notable as the most controversial season in CFP's history.
      <ul>
        <li>The 2023 season saw eight teams in contention for a National Championship before conference championship weekend.</li>
        <li>Michigan was under investigation for the sign-stealing scandal.  Connor Stallions, who was at the center of the scandal, resigned, but the investigation continued into the rest of the regular season.  The Big Ten suspended Jim Harbaugh for the rest of the regular season, but allowed Michigan to continue to play out the regular season.  Michigan eventually won the Big Ten, made the playoffs, and won the National Championship despite the ongoing investigation.  Two years later, the NCAA did find that Michigan did commit violations over three seasons involving an off-campus, in-person scouting scheme, impermissible recruiting, head coach responsibility, failure to cooperate, and failure to monitor.  Despite the severity of the cheating scheme, Michigan was allowed to keep their achievements from 2021-23 (which included three Big Ten championships and a National Championship), but was heavily penalized financially.</li>
        <li>Florida State was left out of the playoff in favor of Big 12 Champion Texas (12-1) and SEC Champion Alabama (12-1).  This was the first time an undefeated power conference champion was left out of the playoff field.  This led to frustrations by ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips and Florida State head coach Mike Norvell.</li>
        <li>Georgia was also left out of the playoff field.  Although they had a close loss to Alabama, current head coach Kirby Smart pled his case that Georgia belonged in the playoff field.</li>
        <li>C-USA Champion Liberty finished an undefeated regular season.  However, they were only ranked 23rd in the CFP due to playing the weakest schedule in the FBS.  Although they had the weakest schedule in the FBS, Liberty was never given a chance to play for a National Championship.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      James Madison was originally ineligible to play in the postseason due to the NCAA FCS to FBS transition rules. However, because there were not enough bowl-eligible teams that season, James Madison was given bowl eligibility. Unfortunately, they would still be ineligible for a playoff spot (as they were also inelgible for the Sun Belt Championship).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mountain West also had a three-way tie for first place in 2023.  UNLV, Boise State, and San Jose State all finished with a 6-2 conference record.  San Jose State did face against UNLV and Boise State.  However, neither Boise State nor UNLV faced each other.  In addition, none of them were ranked in the CFP top 25.  The tie was broken through the average computer rankings from Anderson & Hester, Colley Matrix, Massey, and Wolfe.  UNLV had the best average rankings, while Boise State came in second and San Jose State came in third.  After the tie-breaker, UNLV hosted Boise State and both played for the Mountain West Championship.  Boise State won the game and would earn the automatic bid to the playoffs.
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Kansas (8-4)</td>
          <td>Memphis (9-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Toledo (11-2)</td>
          <td>North Carolina (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tulane (11-2)</td>
          <td>Ohio (9-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Utah (8-4)</td>
          <td>West Virginia (8-4)</td>
        </tr>

    <p>With 7 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 18 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25. Kansas, Utah, Toledo, and Tulane were the teams that have gotten the final at-large playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite going 1-3 against playoff-bound teams, Kansas picked up a signature win against Oklahoma (10-2).  Although they also picked up a bad loss to Texas Tech, their signature win against Oklahoma was enough for them to clinch one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toledo lost their season opener to Illinois (5-7), which became a bad loss at the end of the regular season.  However, they were able to split their meeting against MAC Champion Miami (OH), winning the earlier meeting on the road.  Despite Toledo's bad season opening loss, their road win against the MAC Champion propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      After losing the AAC Championship to SMU, Tulane was dangerously on the verge of not getting a playoff spot.  However, compared to the other fringe teams, Tulane's win against fringe teams UTSA (8-4) and Memphis (9-3) and going undefeated in AAC play were enough to overcome their 0-2 record vs playoff bound teams.  This propelled Tulane for one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      With James Madison ineligible for playoff selection due to FCS-FBS transition rules despite their bowl appearance, the final at-large bid came down to West Virginia, Memphis, North Carolina, and Utah.  Out of those teams, Utah gets the nod due to their strength of schedule, playing 11 of 12 games against power conference opponents with no bad losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out were eliminated by a combination of weak resumes, bad losses, and/or devastating losses.  North Carolina's resume was not very impressive at all as they do not have wins against playoff-bound teams, going 0-2 vs those opportunities.  Their only notable win was a double OT win against Appalachian State (who is among the next teams out). Their other notable win, Miami (FL), lost three of their last four games to drop their record to 7-5.  Combining with their bad losses to Virginia, Duke, and Georgia Tech, North Carolina is unfortunately among the first teams out.  Memphis does have a notable win against Mountain West Champion Boise State.  However, Boise State finished the regular season at 8-5, which is not impressive enough to put Memphis in the field as the Mountain West was among the weakest.  Combined with losing vs additional playoff bound teams, Memphis is among the first teams out.  West Virginia did not have any wins against playoff bound teams, going 0-3 overall against playoff bound teams.  Picking up a bad loss to Houston also did not help their playoff case.  Ohio was plagued by bad losses to San Diego State and Northern Illinois.  With the lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams, this led Ohio to the wrong side of the fringe.
