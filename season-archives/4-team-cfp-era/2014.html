      <h1>2014-15 FBS Playoffs</h1>
      <p>The 2014 season was the first season of the 4-team CFP.  However, the system still had some controversies.
        <ul>
          <li>The last playoff spot came down to Big Ten Champion Ohio State (12-1) and Big 12 Co-Champions Baylor (11-1) and TCU (11-1).</li>
          <li>Former head coach Urban Meyer intentionally ran up the score against Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship game to help Ohio State be selected in the playoff. He admitted that it was not the right thing to do.  In addition, he was not happy with the 'eye test' and 'people think' as he thought that those would have not been enough to push them ahead of Baylor and TCU.  He proposed <a href="https://x.com/CFBONFOX/status/1186009943897456640">a selection system based on a defined criteria</a>.</li>
          <li>Ohio State was selected as the fourth team, leaving out Baylor and TCU.  Ohio State ended up winning the first National Championship in the 4-team playoff.  TCU was assigned the Peach Bowl against Ole Miss, and ended up dominating in the Peach Bowl.  Baylor was assigned to the Cotton Bowl, losing a close game against Michigan State.</li>
          <li>Like its predecessor, the CFP continued to undervalue non-power FBS teams.  Boise State (11-2) was the only team from the non-power FBS conferences to be ranked in the CFP. C-USA Champion Marshall (12-1) and MAC Champion Northern Illinois (11-2) were not ranked in the CFP at all due to their perceived weak schedule.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
      </p>
      <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
      <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
      <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

        Georgia Southern finished an undefeated conference record in the Sun Belt.  However, due to the FCS-to-FBS transition rules, they were ineligible for the postseason.  The automatic bid would then go to the next best team, which was Louisiana.  The AAC had a three-way tie for first.  Cincinnati, Memphis, and UCF were named AAC Co-champions.  Cincinnati and UCF did not play each other and Memphis and UCF did not play each other, so head-to-head cannot be applied.  We then go to common opponents.  Here is how all three fared against common opponents:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Memphis</th>
            <th>Cincinnati</th>

        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, Cincinnati wins the tie-breaker based on common opponents.  Therefore, they would earn the automatic bid to the playoffs.  Memphis and UCF are still tied after the common opponent tie-breaker.  We’ll then look at how each fared against the next highest opponent, which was a tie between East Carolina and Houston.  However, Memphis did not play East Carolina, so it’s onto the next tie-breaker, which is conference strength.  Since Cincinnati already won the second tie-breaker, the fourth tie-breaker for second place is between Memphis and UCF.  This is what it’s going to look like for each:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Memphis</th>
            <th>UCF</th>
          </tr>

          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>W Tulsa (2-6)</td>
            <td>L UConn (1-7)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>W Tulsa (2-6)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>W Tulane (2-6)</td>
            <td>W SMU (1-7)</td>
          </tr>

          </tr>
          <tr>

          <tr>
            <td>25-39 (0.391)</td>
            <td>21-43 (0.328)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, Memphis has the better conference strength than UCF.  Therefore, they would finish second overall, while UCF would finish third overall. 
      </p>
      <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
      <p>
        The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Last Teams In</th>
            <th>First Teams Out</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Air Force (9-3)</td>
            <td>Colorado St (10-2)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Duke (9-3)</td>
            <td>Nebraska (9-3)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Memphis (9-3)</td>
            <td>Oklahoma (8-4)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Minnesota (8-4)</td>
            <td>Utah St (9-4)</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        With 6 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 19 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  Minnesota would clinch one of the final four at-large spots in virtue of being ranked number 25 in the CFP rankings.  However, they went 0-3 vs playoff-bound teams, while also having a bad loss to Illinois. Because there were little to no teams that also have wins vs playoff-bound teams, their win against fringe team Nebraska was enough for the committee to put them at #25 in the CFP Rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final three spots went to Air Force, Duke, and Memphis.  Duke picked up bad losses to North Carolina, Miami (FL), and Virginia Tech.  However, in their only opportunity vs a playoff-bound team, they were able to defeat Georgia Tech, pushing them among one of the last teams in.  Air Force's bad losses to Wyoming and San Diego State do stand out.  However, as the only Mountain West member to beat Boise State along with picking up another crucial win vs fellow fringe team Colorado State, Air Force did just enough to gain one of the last at-large spots.  Finally, it was a tough call between Memphis and Colorado State.  With the AAC tie-breaker falling in Cincinnati's favor to win the AAC's automatic bid, Memphis record vs playoff-bound teams went from 0-2 to 1-2 vs playoff-bound teams.  While losing to Houston was not as big of a deal-breaker, their win vs AAC Co-Champion Cincinnati was enough to push Memphis into the playoff field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first teams out did not have any wins against playoff bound teams.  Nebraska's and Colorado State's overall records were impressive.  However, despite no bad losses, Nebraska went 0-3 vs playoff-bound competition.  Colorado State has no bad losses, but went 0-2 vs playoff-bound competition.  Oklahoma went 0-3 vs playoff-bound competition.  In addition, picking up a bad loss vs their Bedlam rivals Oklahoma State has dented their hopes of making into the field, which led them to falling on the wrong side of the fringe.  Utah State was very close to clinching a playoff field.  However, unlike Memphis, Utah State's bad losses to Tennessee and Arkansas State outweighed their 1-1 record vs playoff-bound competition.
