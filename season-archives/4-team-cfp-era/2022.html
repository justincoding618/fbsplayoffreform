    <h1>2022-23 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2022 season was the ninth season of the 4-team CFP. However, the system oroduced some controversies.
      <ul>
        <li>Notable upsets happened in the conference championship games.  Utah and Kansas State pulled up monumental upsets over their top-seeded counterparts (USC and TCU respectively) and put the 4-team field into chaos.</li>
        <li>TCU was selected to play in the playoff despite losing to Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship game.</li>
        <li>Ohio State was selected as the fourth and final team despite losing to Michigan in the regular season finale. </li>
        <li>Both TCU and Ohio State were selected ahead of ACC Champion Clemson (11-2), Pac-12 Champion Utah (10-3), and Big 12 Champion Kansas State (10-3).  This led to some discussion by analysts of whether the committee should only select conference champions.</li>
        <li>AAC Champion Tulane (11-2), Sun Belt Champion Troy (11-2), and CUSA Champion UTSA (11-2) were all ranked in the CFP Top 25.  However, they were still being undervalued.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      With 8 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 17 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the five best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25.  UCF, along with South Alabama, North Carolina, Boise State, and Marshall, claimed the final five at-large spots.  UCF clinches one of the last at-large spots despite their bad losses to Louisville, Navy, and East Carolina.  Beating AAC Champion Tulane along with fringe team Cincinnati propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boise State and Marshall also clinch two of the final playoff spots.  Boise State's bad losses to UTEP and BYU do stand out.  However, they were able to defeat Mountain West Champion Fresno State earlier in the regular season, which was just enough for them to pick up one of the final playoff spots.  Marshall's case is rather interesting.  Their bad losses to Bowling Green and Louisiana do stand out.  However, their 1-1 record vs playoff-bound teams does outweigh their bad losses.  Their upset win on the road vs Notre Dame and defeating Sun Belt East Co-Champion James Madison (which was inelgible for the postseason at the time) propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last playoff spot was very dicey as the best remaining teams do not have a win vs playoff-bound competition.  However, North Carolina gets the final playoff spot as although they were 0-3 vs playoff-bound teams while also picking up a bad loss to Georgia Tech, their win vs fringe team Pittsburgh was enough to propel them to the final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out did not have any wins against playoff bound teams.  Cincinnati's record was impressive.  However, while they proved that they can compete vs power conference competition, they went 0-2 vs playoff-bound competition as well as picking up a bad loss to Arkansas.  Illinois and Purdue were both plagued by a weakened Big Ten West Division.  Both could not afford to pick up bad losses.  Unfortunately, they did.  Illinois' bad losses to Indiana and Michigan State really stand out as they were not able to pick up their only opportunity vs Michigan.  While Purdue's best win is vs Illinois, they too were not able to overcome their bad losses to Syracuse, Iowa, and Wisconsin, as well as going 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams. Pittsburgh's bad losses to Georgia Tech and Louisville was bad enough that losing to North Carolina (which is barely playoff-bound) dropped them to 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams, and put them on the wrong side of the fringe.
