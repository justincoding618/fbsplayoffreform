    <h1>2016-17 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>The 2016 season was the third season of the 4-team CFP.  However, the system still had some controversies.
      <ul>
        <li>Ohio State (11-1) clinched a playoff spot despite not playing in the Big Ten Championship.</li>
        <li>Penn State and Oklahoma each had two losses.  Penn State advanced to the Big Ten Championship game due to their head-to-head victory over Ohio State earlier in the season.  Oklahoma lost to Ohio State at home earlier in the regular season.</li>
        <li>The CFP did not account the Army-Navy game.  The final rankings always came out the Sunday after the conference championship games.  Navy was ranked 25th in the final CFP rankings.  However, after losing the AAC title game, they lost to Army the next week.</li>
        <li>MAC Champion Western Michigan (13-0) was ranked #15 in the CFP rankings, but were never given a chance to play for a National Championship due to their perceived weak schedule.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The Sun Belt had a two-way tie for first place.  Appalachian State and Arkansas State did not play against each other.  In terms of tie-breakers, head-to-head did not apply and common opponents for each were tied.  The next tie-breaker came in games against the next best conference opponents, which is a tie between Troy and Idaho.  Arkansas State did not play Idaho, so it comes down to the 4th tie-breaker.  The conference strength for each team looks like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Appalachian St</th>
          <th>Arkansas St</th>

      Appalachian State by far played a much tougher conference schedule in the Sun Belt.  Therefore, they break the tie with Arkansas State and would win the automatic bid to the playoffs.  
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>

          <td>North Carolina (8-4)</td>

        <tr>
          <td>South Florida (10-2)</td>

      With 7 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 18 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25. Houston, Memphis, North Carolina, and South Florida were the teams that have gotten the final at-large playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Houston's non-conference resume is very impressive.  They have notable wins against Louisville and Big 12 Champion Oklahoma.  While their bad loss to SMU does stand out, their 2-2 record against playoff bound teams overcomes that bad loss and puts Houston into the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memphis needed a signature win to propel them in as one of the last at-large teams.  After getting one against Houston, Memphis was able to overcome its bad loss to Ole Miss and improve to 2-3 vs playoff bound teams (which included a win against AAC Champion Temple).  
    </p>
    <p>
      South Florida was among the last teams in as their 2-2 record vs playoff bound teams was impressive enough to land them an at-large berth.  Finally, North Carolina clinches one of the final playoff spots.  While their bad losses to Duke and NC State do stand out, they made up for it by getting key wins against fringe team Georgia Tech and playoff bound Pittsburgh (who was the only team to beat Clemson) as well picking up a signature win against Florida State on the road earlier in the season.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the first teams out all did not have enough wins against playoff bound teams.  Georgia Tech did not have a bad resume.  However, they only went 1-3 vs playoff-bound teams.  Miami (FL) has a key win vs Sun Belt Champion Appalachian State.  However, they also have a bad loss to Notre Dame, and it was not enough to overcome their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams.  Finally, the next two of the first teams out did not have any wins vs playoff-bound teams.  While their overall record was impressive, Nebraska went 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams, while their non-conference win against Oregon declined over time.  Boise State's 10-2 was impressive, but lacked any signature wins.  Their best victory came against New Mexico, who was not remotely close to playoff consideration. In contrast, Memphis's 8-4 record that included wins over two playoff teams (AAC Champion Temple and Houston) made them the clear choice for one of the final playoff spots despite Boise State's superior win-loss total.
