      <h1>2015-16 FBS Playoffs</h1>
      <p>
        The 2015 season was the second season of the 4-team CFP. Fittingly, this
        season produced no controversy of which teams would play for a National
        Championship. However, the CFP rankings has continued to undervalue
        non-power FBS teams.  The AAC had three teams represented in the CFP Top 25.  However, C-USA Champion Western Kentucky (11-2) was not ranked in the CFP at all due to their preceived weak schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
      </p>
      <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
      <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
      <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
      <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Last Teams In</th>
            <th>First Teams Out</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Memphis (9-3)</td>
            <td>Appalachian St (10-2)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>South Florida (8-4)</td>
            <td>Georgia (9-3)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>UCLA (8-4)</td>
            <td>Toledo (9-2)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>USC (8-5)</td>
            <td>Wisconsin (9-3)</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        With 6 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 19 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  USC would clinch one of the final four at-large spots in virtue of being ranked number 25 in the CFP rankings.  They have notable wins against Utah and UCLA despite going 2-4 against playoff bound teams and a bad loss to Washington, which was how the committee put them at #25 in the CFP Rankings.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of UCLA, they along with Memphis and South Florida clinch the final three playoff spots.  UCLA and South Florida clinch one of the final two playoff spots by having one signature win.  UCLA's notable win was against Utah, but despite going 1-2 against playoff bound teams and picking up a bad loss to Arizona State, UCLA did just enough to be part of the field.  South Florida picked up a win against AAC Runner-up Temple, but also picked up a bad loss to Maryland.  Despite going 1-3 against playoff bound teams, South Florida did just enough to make it into the field.  Finally, we have Memphis.  Memphis picked up a signature win against Ole Miss.  By also picking up a win against South Florida, Memphis went 2-3 against playoff bound teams, which propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three teams that were among the first out all failed to win against playoff bound teams.  While their 9 wins were very impressive, Georgia and Wisconsin went 0-3 against their playoff bound competition.  Appalachian State's record is impressive.  However, they have failed to pick up wins against playoff-bound teams, going 0-2 when presented those opportunities.  This left them among the first teams out.  Finally, while Toledo's win against MAC Champion Bowling Green was impressive, they also picked up two bad losses to Northern Illinois and Western Michigan.  Had they avoid picking up one of those two losses, Toledo would have likely clinched a playoff spot by winning the MAC themselves.
