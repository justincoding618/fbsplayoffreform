    <h1>2017-18 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>The 2017 season was the fourth season of the 4-team CFP.  However, the system still had some controversies.
      <ul>
        <li>Alabama (11-1) clinched a playoff spot despite not playing in the SEC Championship.</li>
        <li>Ohio State and USC each had two losses.  Auburn advanced to the SEC Championship game due to the head-to-head win over Alabama.</li>
        <li>AAC Champion UCF (12-0) was ranked #12 in the CFP rankings, but were never given a chance to play for a National Championship due to their preceived weak schedule.  They defeated Auburn in the Peach Bowl to complete their undefeated season and claimed a National Championship.</li>
        <li>MAC Champion Toledo (11-2) and Sun Belt Champion Troy (10-2) were not ranked in the CFP at all due to their preceived weak schedule. Troy pulled off an upset against LSU in Baton Rouge earlier in the regular season.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The Sun Belt once again had a two-way tie for first place.  Appalachian State and Troy did not play against each other.  In terms of tie-breakers, head-to-head did not apply and common opponents for each were tied.  The next tie-breaker came in games against the next best conference opponents, which is Arkansas State.  Appalachian State did not play Arkansas State, so it comes down to the 4th tie-breaker.  The conference strength for each team looks like the following:

      Troy just edges out Appalachian State for conference strength in the Sun Belt.  Therefore, Troy would earn the automatic bid to the playoffs.

    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>

    <p>With 7 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 18 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25. Fresno State, San Diego State, South Carolina, and South Florida were the teams that have gotten the final at-large playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresno State was able to pick up wins against San Diego State and Mountain West Champion Boise State.  Despite their bad loss to UNLV, going 2-3 vs playoff bound teams was enough for them to get one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      San Diego State went 0-2 against Boise State and Fresno State.  However, they also made up for those losses by picking up a key win against Stanford.  Without any bad losses, this was enough for San Diego State to gain one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      South Carolina and South Florida are a tale of two different fringe teams that made it.  South Carolina picked up a win against NC State that eventually turned into a key win that propelled them to one of the final playoff spots despite losing two more games against playoff bound teams.  However, although they have bad losses to Texas A&M and Kentucky, South Carolina did just enough to get one of the final playoff spots.  South Florida had no quality wins to back their not so bad losses.  However, compared to the first teams out, South Florida just does enough to get the final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had worse resumes than South Florida.  While Michigan impressed against lower competition, they were 0-4 vs playoff-bound teams.  While Houston's win against South Florida was impressive, it was not able to make up for their bad losses to Texas Tech, Tulsa, and Tulane.  Ohio's situation is very similar to Houston.  While they were the only team in the MAC to beat MAC Champion Toledo, Ohio too could not make up for their bad losses to Purdue, Akron, and Buffalo.  Finally, Army was not able to beat their only opportunity against a playoff bound opponent.  In addition, they had a bad loss to Tulane and a loss to North Texas (who also is not close to being considered in the playoff field).
