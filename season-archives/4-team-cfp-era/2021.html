    <h1>2021-22 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2021 season was the eighth season of the 4-team CFP. Fittingly, this
      season produced no controversy of which teams would play for a National
      Championship. AAC Champion Cincinnati (13-0) finally broke through and
      became the first non-power FBS team to make the playoffs and play for a
      National Championship.  However, the CFP continued to undervalue non-power FBS teams. Sun Belt Champion Louisiana was ranked #23 in the CFP Rankings and CUSA Champion UTSA (12-1) was not ranked in the CFP at all due to their perceived weak schedules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final CFP rankings was used to determine National Seeding, and then the rest of the CFP Rankings and merit-based selection were used to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The final regular season CFP Rankings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <p>With 7 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the CFP Top 25, we see that 18 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season CFP Top 25.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the CFP Top 25.  Minnesota, Fresno State, Purdue, and Wisconsin claimed the final four at-large spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purdue's 2-4 record vs playoff-bound teams may look bad.  However, Purdue's two wins came vs Big Ten West Champion Iowa on the road and Michigan State.  Those wins propelled them to taking one of the final playoff spots.  Minnesota's bad losses to Bowling Green and Illinois would have become an eye sore without their 2-2 record vs playoff-bound teams.  Picking up the regular-season finale win vs Wisconsin was just enough for them to pick up one of the final playoff spots.  Wisconsin picked up big wins vs Purdue and Big Ten West Champion Iowa.  While the season-opening loss to Penn State became a bad loss at the end of the regular season, their 2-3 record vs playoff-bound teams helped propel them for one of the final playoff spots.  Finally, Fresno State was in a very interesting position as their bad losses to Hawaii and Boise State does stand out.  However, with their win vs San Diego State (which is in the playoff field) as well as picking up an additional win at UCLA, this was enough for them to gain the final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out did not have any wins vs playoff-bound teams.  Air Force was not able to win their opportunities vs the Mountain West Champion Utah State and Mountain West runner-up San Diego State.  Although all three of their losses were very close, they were not enough to propel them into the field.  UCLA went 0-3 vs playoff-bound teams, with their key non-conference win vs LSU declining to a 6-6 regular season.  They have no bad losses, but not being able to pick up wins vs playoff-bound teams put them on the wrong-side of the fringe.  Appalachian State's best win was vs Coastal Carolina.  However, they were not able to beat Sun Belt Champion Louisiana both times while also picking up a bad loss to Miami (FL).  Coastal Carolina's bad loss to Georgia State became an eye-sore as they have failed to pick up any wins vs playoff-bound teams.
