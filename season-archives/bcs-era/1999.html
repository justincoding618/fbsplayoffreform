    <h1>1999-2000 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 1999 season was the second season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>The BCS once again put in six conference champions from the AQ conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10, and SEC), which left only two at-large spots for the BCS bowls.</li>
        <li>Kansas State (10-1) finished 6th in the final BCS standings.  However, they were left out of the BCS bowl games for the second consecutive season.</li>
        <li>Michigan State (9-2) finished in a tie for second place in the Big Ten with their in-state rival Michigan (9-2).  Despite Michigan State having the head-to-head tie-breaker over Michigan, the BCS ranked Michigan ahead of Michigan State.  This led to Michigan being selected for a BCS bowl over Michigan State.  Tennessee was selected as the other at-large bid for one of the BCS bowls.</li>
        <li>MAC Champion Marshall (11-0) was overlooked.  Although Marshall finished 12th in the BCS Standings, they were completely ignored for a potential at-large bid and were considered "weak" according to the computers.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 1999 season, the BCS at the time only ranked down to the lowest AQ team (which in most cases was the Top 15).  However, thanks to the <a href="https://masseyratings.com/ranks?s=cf&d=19991206">Massey Composite Ratings</a> that provided the full 1999 BCS Standings that ranked all teams, a combination of the full BCS rankings and merit-based selection was used to determine the rest of the field. However, I only used the full BCS standings up to the Top 25.  The playoff matchups are based on the final regular season BCS Ratings from 1999.

    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      Here, we had to break ties in the Mountain West and the WAC.  The Mountain West and WAC had a three-way tie for first place.  The WAC's tie was broken via the average computer rankings between Anderson & Hester (A&H), Billingsley (Bill.), Colley Matrix (CM), Massey (Mass.), Sagarin (Sag.), and Wolfe.  The WAC tie-breaker went as follows:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Team</th>
          <th>Anderson and Hester</th>
          <th>Billingsley</th>
          <th>Colley Matrix</th>
          <th>Massey Ratings</th>
          <th>Sagarin</th>

      Fresno State breaks the tie between TCU and Hawaii, and would be the overall WAC champion.  They would earn the WAC’s automatic bid to the playoffs.  The Mountain West tie breaker, on the other hand, came down to the final BCS rankings.  With BYU being the only Mountain West team ranked in the BCS top 25, they would earn the automatic bid.  However, if you're wondering how the tie was broken based on the computer ratings, they were the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Team</th>
          <th>Anderson and Hester</th>
          <th>Billingsley</th>

          <th>Massey Ratings</th>

      BYU breaks the tie between Utah and Colorado State, and would be the overall Mountain West champion.

        <th>First Teams Out</th>

      With 9 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Top 25, 16 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This left us with five at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. Utah was able to put themselves as safely in as they were the only Mountain West Co-Champion to defeat BYU while also not displaying any bad losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkansas, Louisiana Tech, Virginia, and Washington claim the final at-large bids.  Washington was in a danger zone with the bad losses that they accumulated.  Their bad losses to Air Force, Arizona State, and UCLA nearly denied them one of the last at-large playoff spots.  However, their wins vs Stanford and Oregon propelled them to one of the final at-large spots.  Louisiana Tech's bad loss to USC does stand out.  However, their 1-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, with their biggest win vs SEC Champion Alabama, propelled them to one of the final at-large spots.  Arkansas's bad losses to LSU and Kentucky would have eliminated them from the field if they did not have critical wins vs Tennessee and Mississippi State.  However, their 2-1 record vs playoff-bound teams was just enough to put them as one of the final teams in.  Virgina was also on the verge of being one of the first teams out because of their bad losses to Duke and Clemson.  However, their wins vs Mountain West Co-Champion BYU and their ACC foe Georgia Tech were enough to put them in as one of the final teams to make it into the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out definitely had cases.  However, they were not enough to be included in the field.  Ole Miss definitely had the most legitimate case to be included.  However, their bad loss to Vanderbilt as well as their win vs Georgia also being a fringe team and Arkansas just barely making the field was enough to put them out of the field.  Georgia's win vs Ole Miss is good.  However, their 0-3 record vs playoff-bound teams as well as a bad loss to Auburn placed them on the wrong side of the fringe.  Boston College's 0-2 record vs playoff-bound teams as well as a bad loss to Temple also placed them on the wrong side of the field.  Finally, Oklahoma did have a legitimate case to be included in the field.  However, their bad losses vs Colorado, Texas Tech, and Notre Dame were not enough to overcome their best win vs Texas A&M.
