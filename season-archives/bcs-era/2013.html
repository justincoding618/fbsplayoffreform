    <h1>2013-14 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2013 season was the sixteenth and final season of the BCS. It is also the first season of the Big East (1979-2013) rebranding to the AAC and the only season the AAC is a power conference.  Fittingly,
      this season produced no controversy of which teams would play for a
      National Championship as Florida State won an instant classic against
      Auburn. However, the BCS still continued to pass over higher ranked teams
      as they chose Oklahoma to play in the Sugar Bowl over Oregon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2013 season marked the eleventh and final season where the BCS ranked the
      top 25. Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <p>
      The Sun Belt had a tie between Louisiana and Arkansas State.  Louisiana would win the tie-breaker as it has the head-to-head over Arkansas State and would earn the Sun Belt’s automatic bid to the playoffs.
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:

          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>

          <td>Notre Dame (8-4)</td>

    <p>
      With 7 out of 10 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, we see that 18 out of the 22 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season BCS Standings.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the BCS. BYU, Notre Dame, Texas, and Vanderbilt were the teams that have gotten the final at-large playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Texas has a key bad loss vs Ole Miss.  However, while their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams may not be impressive on the surface, their win vs Oklahoma propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.  Vanderbilt is in a similar situation as Texas, as they also have a bad loss vs Ole Miss.  Despite going 1-3 vs playoff-bound teams, their win vs Georgia gave them a ticket to one of the final playoff spots.  BYU and Notre Dame were both Independents with bad losses, but having that quality win placed them on the right side of the fringe.  Notre Dame suffered bad losses to Pittsburgh and Michigan, but their 4-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, which included signature wins vs Arizona State, Big Ten Champion Michigan State, USC, and BYU outweighed their two bad losses, giving Notre Dame the other final playoff spot. On the other hand, BYU's bad losses to Virginia and Utah would have dented their playoff hopes, but their win vs Texas while having a 1-2 overall record vs playoff-bound teams saved their hopes, leading them to one of the final playoff spots.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The same cannot be said for the first teams out.  Ball State's overall record is impressive.  However, if your overall record is the only thing that you have, then you don't have much. Ball State lost their only opportunity vs playoff-bound Northern Illinois.  While losing to North Texas is not as bad, Ball State did not have any wins vs playoff-bound teams.  Iowa won the games that they're supposed to win, but none of them were playoff-bound teams, going 0-4 in those contests.  Virginia Tech's win vs Miami (FL) would be impressive on the surface.  However, Miami (FL) is also among the first teams out, which did not help either.  Both went 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams.  However, Virginia Tech's bad losses to Boston College and Maryland kept them on the wrong side of the fringe.  Miami (FL) also landed on the wrong side of the fringe for similar reasons as Iowa and Ball State.
