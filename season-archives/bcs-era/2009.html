    <h1>2009-10 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2009 season was the twelfth season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>Five teams finished an undefeated regular season. Alabama, Texas, Cincinnati, Boise State, and TCU all finished within the top eight of the final BCS standings.</li>
        <li>Cincinnati, Boise State, and TCU were not selected to play for a National Championship.  Ironically, Boise State and TCU were both pitted against each other in the Fiesta Bowl, causing outcry and criticism about how the BCS made their decision.</li>
        <li>It continued to solidify the BCS's narrative that only power conference teams are more deserving to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>Alabama and Boise State became the only two teams to finish their undefeated season. However, the decision to put Boise State and TCU in the same bowl left many wonder how good would they have done against power conference opponents.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2009 season marked the seventh season where the BCS ranked the top 25.
      Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.

    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The 2009 season was definitely the best for conference champions.  Out of the 11 conference champions, 8 were ranked in the final BCS top 10!  In addition, there were no ties to the conference champions  All were undisputed.  
    </p>  
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>California (8-4)</td>
          <td>Clemson (8-5)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Houston (10-3)</td>
          <td>Ole Miss (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Northwestern (8-4)</td>
          <td>Rutgers (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>North Carolina (8-4)</td>
          <td>Texas Tech (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      With 8 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 17 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This was enough for four at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cal, Houston, Northwestern, and North Carolina would claim the final at-large bids.  Cal went 2-3 vs playoff-bound teams, picking up wins vs Arizona and Stanford.  Though their bad loss to Washington does stand out, their wins vs Arizona and Stanford propelled them to one of the last playoff spots.  Houston's bad loss to UTEP would have put them out of playoff contention if they did not pick up a win vs Oklahoma State as well as getting a win vs Texas Tech to go 2-0 vs the Big 12. Houston did just enough to get one of the final playoff spots. Northwestern's resume is very polarizing.  They picked up bad losses to Minnesota, Michigan State, and Syracuse.  However, their 2-1 record vs playoff-bound competition, picking up wins vs Iowa and Wisconsin were enough to give them one of the last playoff spots.  North Carolina went 2-2 vs playoff-bound teams, but also picked up bad losses to Florida State, NC State, and Virginia.  Despite those bad losses, picking up wins vs Virginia Tech and Miami (FL) were enough to give them one of the last playoff spots. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Clemson does have a key win vs Miami (FL).  However, their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams, as well as their two bad losses to Maryland and South Carolina were enough to keep them out of the field.  Ole Miss has a key win vs LSU.  However, their bad losses to South Carolina and Auburn as well as their 1-2 record vs playoff-bound teams kept them out of the playoff field.  Rutgers lacked the wins vs playoff-bound teams to be considered for a playoff spot, going 0-3 as well as picking up a bad loss to Syracuse. Texas Tech has a key win vs Nebraska.  However, their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams as well as a picking up a bad loss to Texas A&M was enough to be among the first teams out.
