    <h1>2007-08 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
    The 2007 season was the tenth season of the BCS. It was a season full of upsets that led to chaos in the final weeks of the regular season:
      <ul>
        <li>On November 10, Ohio State lost to Illinois, which has dented their chance to play for a National Championship.  They were able to take care of business against Michigan the next week, but were in a wait-and-see what happens in the final two weeks of the season.</li>
        <li>During Thanksgiving Weekend, LSU picked up their second loss of the season in triple overtime against Arkansas (LSU's first loss came against Kentucky).  The next day, Missouri defeated Kansas and were ranked #1 in the BCS for the first time.</li>
        <li>The following week, Missouri lost to Oklahoma in the Big 12 Championship Game.  West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh in their final game of the regular season.</li>
        <li>Ohio State rose to #1 despite being idle for the final two weeks of the regular season.</li>
        <li>Hawaii finished an undefeated regular season, but were not considered for a National Championship as they were deemed too weak, which continued the trend of the BCS overlooking non-power FBS teams.</li>
        <li>LSU, Virginia Tech, and Oklahoma rounded out the top four, meaning LSU was able to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>The BCS had a rule where up to only two teams from each AQ conference were allowed to play in bowl games.  This left Missouri (despite their head-to-head over Kansas) out of the BCS bowl rotation.  If the rule was omitted, Missouri would have likely gotten the final at-large BCS bid over Illinois.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2007 season marked the fifth season where the BCS ranked the top 25.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.  
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    </p>
    <p>
      In the Big East, West Virginia and UConn both shared the conference title.  However, West Virginia would earn the automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over UConn.  The same would apply in the Pac-10 and Sun Belt.  USC would earn the Pac-10’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Arizona State.  In the Sun Belt, Florida Atlantic (FAU) would earn the conference’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Troy.  
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      With 8 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 17 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This was enough for four at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2007 fringe was definitely tough to decide.  Six teams have legitimate cases to make the playoffs.  However, only four can clinch the final playoff spots.  Oregon has a very polarizing resume.  They picked up key wins vs Michigan, Arizona State, and Pac-10 Champion USC.  However, they also have bad losses to Cal, Arizona, and UCLA.  Despite those bad losses, their wins vs Michigan, Arizona State, and USC helped Oregon claim one of the final playoff spots.  The final three spots were definitely tough to decide.  It came down to Michigan, Penn State, Arkansas, Texas Tech, and Oregon State.  
      <ul>
        <li>Michigan has the historic bad loss to Appalachian State.  However, their wins vs Penn State and Illinois (who was the only team to beat Ohio State in the regular season) has kept them alive.</li>
        <li>Oregon State won the Civil War rivalry vs Oregon.  However, their bad loss to UCLA dents their resume as they do not have any other key wins.</li>
        <li>Arkansas picked up a crucial win vs SEC Champion LSU, but also picked up bad losses to Alabama and Kentucky. </li>
        <li>Penn State has a win vs Wisconsin.  However, their bad loss to Michigan State dents their resume as they do not have any other key wins.</li>
        <li>Texas Tech has a signature win vs Big 12 Champion Oklahoma.  However, their bad losses to Colorado and Oklahoma State dents their resume as they do have any other key wins.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Michigan and Penn State would pick up two of the three final playoff spots.  Michigan's loss to FCS opponent Appalachian State does really stand out.  However, they did not have any other bad losses on their resume, and their wins vs Penn State and Illinois was just enough to give them one of the final playoff spots.  Penn State's case was very similar to Michigan.  However, without any other bad losses, that was enough to also give them one of the final playoff spots.  The final playoff spot went to Oregon State because despite their one bad loss to UCLA, they did not have anymore bad losses, which was enough to give them the at-large berth.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Arkansas's signature win vs SEC Champion LSU was not enough to overcome the bad losses to Alabama and Kentucky.  Texas Tech's signature win vs Big 12 Champion Oklahoma was not enough to overcome bad losses to Colorado and Oklahoma State.  Navy and Wake Forest fell on the wrong side of the fringe for the wrong reasons.  Wake Forest's win vs Navy was not enough to overcome their lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams.  Navy also lost to an FCS opponent, Delaware (who eventually moved up to the FBS in 2025).  However, unlike Michigan (who recovered with key wins), Navy also has bad losses to Rutgers and Ball State.  Combined with the lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams, it was more than enough to keep Navy out of the playoff field.
