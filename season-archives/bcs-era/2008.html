      <h1>2008-09 FBS Playoffs</h1>
      <p>
        The 2008 season was the eleventh season of the BCS. However, the following controversies happened:
        <ul>
          <li>Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech were in a 3-way tie for the Big 12 South Division title. The BCS standings were used to break the tie.  Oklahoma gained the right to play for the Big 12 Championship despite losing to Texas earlier in the regular season.  The SEC at the time used the BCS rankings to eliminate one team in a 3-way tie and then used head-to-head to break ties, which would have worked in Texas' favor.</li>
          <li>Mountain West Champion Utah and WAC Champion Boise State both produced undefeated regular seasons.  However, both were denied a chance to play for a national championship due to their schedules being too weak, which still continued the trend of the BCS overlooking non-power FBS teams.</li>
          <li>Utah was chosen for a BCS bowl for the second time, leaving out Boise State.</li>
          <li>Utah became the only team to finish undefeated and ranked #2 in the final AP Poll.</li>
          <li>The Mountain West Conference proposed an 8-team playoff and wanted to utilize a selection committee to rank teams and to change the automatic qualifier rules.  However, the plan was rejected.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2008 season marked the sixth season where the BCS ranked the top 25.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.  
      </p>
      <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
      <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
      <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      <p>
        In the Big Ten, Penn State and Ohio State both shared the conference title.  However, Penn State would earn the Big Ten’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Ohio State.  
      </p>
      <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
      <p>
        The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

            <th>Last Teams In</th>
            <th>First Teams Out</th>

            <td>California (8-4)</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Iowa (8-4)</td>
            <td>Nebraska (8-4)</td>
          </tr>

        With 8 cout of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 17 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This was enough for four at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cal, Iowa, North Carolina, and Oregon State would claim the final at-large bids.  Despite the bad loss to Arizona, Cal was able to pick up a crucial win vs Oregon.  It was enough to give them one of the final playoff spots.  Iowa's bad loss to Illinois does stand out.  However, picking up a signature win vs Big Ten Co-Champion Penn State helped give them one of the last playoff spots.  Oregon State was the only team to beat Pac-10 Champion USC.  Their bad loss to Stanford does stick out.  However, their signature win vs USC as well as Cal was enough to give Oregon State one of the final playoff spots. Lastly, North Carolina's resume is very polarizing.  They have key wins vs Boston College and Georgia Tech.  However, bad losses to Virginia, NC State, and Maryland does stand out without those wins.  Despite those bad losses, their wins vs Boston College and Georgia Tech led them to claim the last playoff spot.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Nebraska lacked wins vs playoff bound teams, going 0-4 in those opportunities.  Florida State also lacked wins vs playoff bound teams, going 0-3 in those opportunities while also picking up a bad loss to Wake Forest.  Those led both Florida State and Nebraska to being on the wrong side of the fringe.  Tulsa was very close to clinching a playoff spot as a conference champion.   However, their bad losses to Arkansas and Houston as well as not picking up any wins vs playoff-bound teams placed them among the first teams out.  West Virginia also did not have any wins vs playoff-bound teams.  They have gone 0-3 in those opportunities and also picked up a bad loss to Colorado, also placing them among the first teams out.
