    <h1>2001-02 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2001 season was the fourth season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>While Miami (FL) was the #1 ranked team, there were legit contenders for the #2 team in the country.  Nebraska, Colorado, and Oregon all had legitimate claims to play for a National Championship.  Nebraska went into the Colorado game undefeated, but were completely blown out by Colorado.  Colorado went on to win the Big 12 Championship, while Oregon was #2 in the AP and USA Today polls.</li>
        <li>Nebraska edges out Colorado and Oregon for the #2 spot despite not winning the Big 12.</li>
        <li>The BCS computers did not account for when the loss happened.  As a result, the computers influence was reduced from 50% to 1/3, while the human polls factored 2/3 of the calculation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 2001 season, the BCS at the time only ranked down to the lowest AQ team (which in most cases was the Top 15).  However, thanks to the <a href="https://masseyratings.com/ranks?s=cf&d=20011210">Massey Composite Ratings</a> that provided the full 2001 BCS Standings that ranked all teams, a combination of the full BCS rankings and merit-based selection was used to determine the rest of the field. However, I only used the full BCS standings up to the Top 25.  The playoff matchups are based on the final regular season BCS Ratings from 2001.

    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <p>
      The 2001 season marked the first season the Sun Belt Conference sponsored football.  For its inaugural season, the tie was broken to determine the automatic bid.  The Sun Belt had a two-way tie for first.  Despite producing a losing record, North Texas (5-6) would earn the automatic bid as they broke the head-to-head tie breaker over Middle Tennessee.  
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS Standings was used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while merit-based selection was used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The Last Teams in and the First Teams Out would have been the following:

        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Arkansas (7-4)</td>
          <td>Hawaii (8-3)</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Ole Miss (7-4)</td>

    <p>
      With 7 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Top 25, 18 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This left us with only three at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. Ohio State would clinch one of the final four at-large spots in virtue of being ranked number 25 in the BCS rankings.  Although they had two bad losses to Wisconsin and Penn State, picking up a win vs Michigan was critical, as that improved them to 1-1 vs playoff-bound teams, which gave the computers enough to put them in the top 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkansas, Boise State, and Ole Miss claim the final at-large bids. Arkansas's bad loss to Alabama does stand out.  However, their 3-3 record vs playoff-bound teams was impressive to give them one of the three playoff spots.  Ole Miss does have a bad loss to Mississippi State.  However, their signature win vs SEC Champion LSU (depsite Ole Miss's 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams) was enough to propel them to one of the three final playoff spots.  The final playoff spot came down to Boise State and Hawaii.  Both won vs Fresno State (Fresno State has key wins vs Big 12 Champion Colorado and WAC Champion Lousiana Tech).  However, Boise State gets the edge.  Their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams could have put them out of the playoff field.  However, the difference between the two is that Boise State has no bad losses and played a tougher non-conference schedule, while Hawaii has a bad loss to Nevada and played a weaker non-conference schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out did not have enough to be included in the field. Hawaii unfortunately did not do enough as their bad loss to Nevada put them on the wrong side of the fringe.  NC State did pick up a win vs Florida State.  However, they were plagued by a weakened ACC.  Their bad losses to North Carolina, Clemson, and Georgia Tech kept them out of the playoff field.  Marshall does not have bad losses.  However, they lack the wins vs playoff bound teams that would put them in the field.  Texas Tech is the same as Marshall, but they also picked up a bad loss to Kansas, which put them among the first teams out.
