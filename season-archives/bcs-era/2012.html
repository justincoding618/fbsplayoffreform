    <h1>2012-13 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2012 season was the fifteenth season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>Ohio State finished an undefeated season, but was ineligible to play in the postseason due to NCAA penalties related to Tattoogate.</li>
        <li>Oregon, Kansas State, and Notre Dame were in contention for a National Championship.  If all three won out, Notre Dame's path would have been difficult as the human polls highly favored Kansas State and Oregon.  However, with Kansas State and Oregon both losing in the same week, Notre Dame became the front-runner.  Notre Dame took care of business and locked up a berth to the National Championship game.  Oregon and Kansas State eventually met in the Fiesta Bowl, where Oregon defeated Kansas State 35-17.</li>
        <li>Alabama and Georgia rose into the Top 3.  Their SEC Championship Game matchup determined who will play Notre Dame.  Alabama won through a come-from-behind victory, cementing their spot in the title game.  They easily defeated Notre Dame for the National Championship.</li>
        <li>Northern Illinois earned a spot in a BCS bowl due to meeting all the BCS requirements.  The BCS had a requirement where a non-AQ team had to finish 16th or higher and be ranked ahead of at least one AQ champion to clinch a berth.  Northern Illinois ranked 15th in the BCS and was ranked higher than Big East Champion Louisville and Big Ten Champion Wisconsin (both AQ champions).  This led to criticism by analysts, claiming that Northern Illinois did not play a legitmate schedule.  However, computer rankings showed Northern Illinois having a stronger schedule than Boise State, as the Mountain West was weakened due to the departures of TCU, BYU and Utah, resulting in Boise State having the lowest computer-ranking percentage of any team in the BCS standings.  Northern Illinois earned a bid to the Orange Bowl, but was blown out by ACC Champion Florida State.</li>        
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ohio State's 12-0 season would have earned them a top four seed if not for NCAA sanctions. Penn State (8-4) and North Carolina (8-4) were also ineligible, though their resumes were borderline at best. UTSA (8-4) was ineligible due to FCS-to-FBS transition rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2012 season marked the tenth season where the BCS ranked the top 25.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The 2012 season marked the final season the WAC sponsored football. Utah State would clinch the WAC's final automatic bid before the WAC dropped football (the WAC eventually reinstated football for FCS, but merged with some of the Atlantic Sun members to make a United Athletic Conference for football only before formally rebranding as the UAC beginning on July 1, 2026).  
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big East had a 4-way tie for first place.  Louisville, Cincinnati, Rutgers, and Syracuse tied for first place.  The tie-breakers went as follows:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Team</th>
          <th>Common Opponents</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Louisville</td>
          <td>2-1 vs Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Syracuse</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Rutgers</td>
          <td>2-1 vs Louisville, Cincinnati, and Syracuse</td>

          <td>1-2 vs Louisville, Rutgers, and Syracuse</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Syracuse</td>
          <td>1-2 vs Louisville, Rutgers, and Cincinnati</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Louisville and Rutgers went 2-1 in the head-to-head matchups, while Cincinnati and Syracuse went 1-2 in the head-to-head matchups.  Cincinnati would finish 3rd overall as it owns the head-to-head tie-breaker over Syracuse.  Louisville wins the tie-breaker (as Louisville beat Rutgers head-to-head) and would get the Big East’s automatic bid. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mountain West had a three-way tie for first.  Boise State, San Diego State, and Fresno State were all tied head-to-head and with common opponents.  The tie-breaker came down to conference strength.  This is what it would look like:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Boise State</th>
          <th>Fresno State</th>
          <th>San Diego State</th>
        </tr>

          <td>W New Mexico (1-7)</td>

          <td>W UNLV (2-6)</td>
          <td>L Boise St (7-1)</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

        <tr>
          <td>28-34 (0.438)</td>
          <td>31-33 (0.484)</td>
          <td>31-33 (0.484)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresno State and San Diego State both have the same conference strength.  However, Fresno State edges San Diego State due to head-to-head, so they would have the automatic bid.  San Diego State would be the conference runner-up in this case.  Boise State would finish 3rd in the Mountain West overall (despite being ranked in the final BCS standings).
    </p>  
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>
    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ball St (9-3)</td>
          <td>Cincinnati (9-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Kent St (11-2)</td>
          <td>Louisiana Tech (9-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>San Diego St (9-3)</td>
          <td>Rutgers (9-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Toledo (9-3)</td>
          <td>Vanderbilt (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      With four out of 11 conference champions being unranked, we see that 18 out of the 21 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season BCS Standings.  Kent State would clinch one of the final four at-large spots in virtue of being ranked number 25 in the BCS standings.  Although they have a bad loss vs Kentucky, while Kent State fell vs their only playoff-bound opportunity vs Northern Illinois in the MAC Championship game, they picked up a critical win vs Rutgers earlier in the regular season, which led the computers to keep Kent State in the BCS standings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final three spots went to Toledo, San Diego State, and Toledo.  San Diego State's bad loss to Washington could have been a deal-breaker.  However, their 1-2 overall record vs playoff-bound teams, which included picking up a win vs Mountain West Co-Champion Boise State gave them one of the final at-large spots.  The last playoff spots were very dicey as the best remaining teams do not have a win vs playoff-bound competition.  However, Ball State and Toledo gained the final playoff spots because although they were winless vs playoff-bound teams (Toledo is 0-2 with a bad loss to Arizona, while Ball State is 0-3), they also picked up wins vs power conference competition.  Toledo's critical win vs Big East Co-Champion Cincinnati gave them enough to get one of the last playoff spots, while Ball State going 2-1 vs power conference teams, while also picking up a critical win vs Toledo propelled them to the other final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same cannot be said for the first teams out.  Cincinnati being on the losing end of their regular season matchup vs Toledo along with failing to pick up a critical win vs Big East Co-Champions Louisville and Rutgers was enough to put them out of the playoff field.  Louisiana Tech almost had a perfect case to enter the playoff field.  However, going 0-3 vs playoff-bound competition pushed them to the wrong side of the fringe.  The win vs Cincinnati almost gave Rutgers a bid to the playoffs.  However, their 0-2 record vs playoff-bound teams as well as picking up a bad loss to Pittsburgh kept them out of the field.  Had Vanderbilt turned one of their four losses vs playoff-bound competition to a win, they would have been on the right-side of the fringe.  However, going 0-4 vs playoff-bound competition did not help Vanderbilt's case, putting them on the wrong side of the fringe.
