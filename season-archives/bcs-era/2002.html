    <h1>2002-03 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2002 season was the fifth season of the BCS. This season was not
      controversial for the championship game selections. However, Alabama was
      ineligible for postseason play at the time due to NCAA violations. Once
      again, the BCS continued to overlook non-FBS power conference teams. This
      time, Boise State was overlooked. In addition, the BCS completely ignored
      WAC Champion Boise State for a potential at-large bid and were considered
      "weak". Alabama finished a 10-3 season, but was ineligible to play in the postseason due to NCAA penalties.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2002 season was the final time the BCS only ranked down to the lowest AQ Team.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding.  Then, a combination of the AP Poll, <a href="https://masseyratings.com/ranks?s=cf&d=20021209">Massey Composite Ratings</a>, and merit-based selection was used to determine the rest of the field. The playoff matchups are based on the final regular season BCS and Massey Composite Ratings from 2002.
    </p> 
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      Ties were broken in a few conferences to determine the automatic bids.  CUSA had a two-way tie between Cincinnati and TCU.  Cincinnati wins the head-to-head tie-breaker and would earn the automatic bid to the playoffs.  Washington State wins the head-to-head Pac-10 tie-breaker over USC and would earn the automatic bid to the playoffs.  In the Big Ten, Ohio State and Iowa both went undefeated in conference play.  However, because both did not play against each other in the regular season, the tie-breaker came down to the rankings.  Ohio State broke the tie by having the highest ranking over Iowa.  The Buckeyes would earn the automatic bid to the playoffs.
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      A combination of the final regular season BCS and AP Poll were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      Alabama would have at least played for the SEC Championship and would have earned at least an at-large bid and possibly be in contention for a national seed if not for NCAA sanctions.

    <h2>Last Teams In and First Teams Out</h2>

          <th>First Teams Out</th>

      With 8 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in either the BCS or AP Poll, 17 out of the 22 at-large bids were taken by teams that were either ranked in the final BCS Standings or the AP Poll.  This left us with four at-large bids for teams that were neither ranked in the BCS nor AP Poll.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Boston College, LSU, Texas Tech, and Tennessee would claim the final at-large bids.  Both LSU and Tennessee went 1-3 vs playoff-bound competition.  LSU picked up a key win vs Florida, while Tennessee was able to pick up a crucial triple overtime win vs Arkansas (who represented the SEC West that year because Alabama was ineligible for the postseason due to NCAA sanctions.).  Both were able to clinch two of the final playoff spots.  Texas Tech played one of the toughest non-conference schedules and went 1-4 vs playoff-bound teams.  They were able to pick up a critical win vs Texas despite also having a bad loss to Iowa State.  That crucial win vs Texas led them to one of the final playoff spots.  Boston College also went 1-4 vs playoff-bound teams.  However, that one win was vs Notre Dame, which propelled them to one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out did not have enough to be included in the field. Hawaii fell on the wrong side of the fringe as they failed to pick up crucial wins vs Boise State and Alabama, and also has a bad loss to BYU.  Arizona State was plagued by a weakened Pac-10.  They did have a nice win vs Oregon State, but bad losses to North Carolina, Nebraska and Cal doomed their chances to pick up a playoff spot.  TCU and South Florida both have impressive records.  While both of TCU's losses were close, they were plagued by the lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams.  South Florida also does not have any wins vs playoff-bound teams, where both of their losses were blowout losses.
