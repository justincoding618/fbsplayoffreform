    <h1>2004-05 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2004 season was the sixth season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>Five teams finished an undefeated regular season. USC, Oklahoma, Auburn, Utah, and Boise State all finished within the top 10 of the final BCS standings.</li>
        <li>Auburn, Utah, and Boise State were not selected to play for a National Championship.  Utah and Boise State's schedules were considered weaker than Auburn's.</li>
        <li>Despite this, Utah became the first team from a non-AQ conference to play in a BCS bowl.  Boise State was not chosen despite being ranked 9th in the BCS.</li>
        <li>Auburn and Utah both won their bowl games, while USC crushed Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.  However, Boise State lost in their bowl game, leaving with three undefeated teams remaining.</li>
        <li>Auburn finished as the final #2 team, while Utah finished as the #4 team, leaving many wondering the real national champion.</li>
        <li>In addition, Texas jumped Cal to try to get the final BCS at-large bid by vote lobbying.  They were able to earn enough to claim a spot in the Rose Bowl against Michigan (and won the instant classic) over Cal.</li>
        <li>This marked the final season of the AP Poll being used in the calculations of the BCS standings.</li>
        <li>On June 10, 2010, USC had to later vacate their last two wins of the 2004 season (along with their entire 2005 season) due to the improper benefits with Reggie Bush.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2004 season marked the second season where the BCS ranked the top 25.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.   
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      In the Big Ten, Michigan and Iowa shared the conference title. However, Michigan would earn the Big Ten’s automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Iowa.  The Big East had a four-way tie for first.  The tie-breakers went as follows:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Team</th>
          <th>Common Opponents</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pittsburgh</td>
          <td>2-1 vs Syracuse, West Virginia, and Boston College</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Syracuse</td>
          <td>2-1 vs Pittsburgh, West Virginia, and Boston College</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Boston College</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>West Virginia</td>
          <td>1-2 vs Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and West Virginia</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Boston College and West Virginia both were on the losing end as they went 1-2 head-to-head against common opponents.  However, Boston College would finish 3rd as it owned the head-to-head tiebreaker over West Virginia.  Pittsburgh and Syracuse went 2-1 head-to-head against common opponents.  However, Pittsburgh would win the overall tie-breaker as it owned the head-to-head tie-breaker over Syracuse.  
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <p>The Last Teams in and the First Teams Out would have been the following:

          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>

      With 9 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 16 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Standings.  This left us with five at-large bids for teams that were not in the BCS Standings.  Purdue was able to be safely in.  Despite their bad loss to Northwestern, their win vs Ohio State was able to propel them into the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boston College, Miami (OH), UConn, and West Virginia would claim the final at-large bids.  Despite the bad losses to Syracuse and Georgia Tech, UConn was able to pick up a key win vs Pittsburgh, leading them to one of the final at-large spots.  Despite bad losses to Wake Forest and Syracuse, Boston College's wins vs UConn and West Virginia were enough to propel them to one of the final playoff spots. Despite going 1-3 vs playoff bound teams, West Virginia's win vs UConn as well as not having any bad losses was good enough to propel them to one of the final playoff spots.  Miami (OH)'s bad losses to Cincinnati and Marshall do stand out.  However, their win vs MAC Champion Toledo in an earlier regular season meeting was enough to propel them to the final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Navy's overall record is impressive.  However, they did not have any wins vs playoff-bound competition as well has having bad losses to Notre Dame and Tulane.  UTEP just did not have any wins vs playoff-bound competition, while also picking up a bad loss to Tulsa.  Their best win, Fresno State, was not enough to propel them into the field as Fresno State also just fell on the wrong side of the fringe.  Speaking of Fresno State, they could not pick up a win vs WAC Champion Boise State as well as gained a bad loss to Louisiana Tech.  Memphis' lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams as well as their bad loss to Cincinnati kept them out of the field.
