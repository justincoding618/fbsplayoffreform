    <h1>2003-04 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2003 season was the sixth season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>No teams finished an undefeated regular season. USC, LSU, and Oklahoma were the top three teams.</li>
        <li>USC was ranked 1st in the human polls, but had a weaker computer ranking due to losing to Cal during the regular season.</li>
        <li>Oklahoma had an undefeated record going into the Big 12 Championship Game.  However, they lost to Kansas State in blowout fashion.  Oklahoma dropped to 3rd in the human polls, but the computers favored them enough to keep them first as the computer rankings did not take account on when the loss happened.</li>
        <li>LSU earned the #2 spot in the BCS standings due to stronger computer ratings than USC.  They went on to beat Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl, which served as the BCS National Championship Game.</li>
        <li>USC was #3 in the BCS.  They easily defeated Big Ten Champion Michigan in the Rose Bowl.</li>
        <li>The national champion ended up not being unanimous. A split championship happened between USC and LSU. The AP poll proclaimed USC as the National Champion, while the USA Today poll had to rank the BCS National Champion, which was LSU.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2003 season marked the first season where the BCS ranked the top 25.  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field.   
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      With 9 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 16 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Standings.  This left us with five at-large bids for teams that were not in the BCS Standings.  Michigan State was able to be safely in.  Despite their bad losses to Wisconsin and Louisiana Tech, they were able to pick up critical wins vs Minnesota and Iowa.  Those wins were were enough to put them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2003 fringe was definitely the toughest one so far.  Eight teams have legitimate cases to make the playoffs.  However, only four can clinch the final playoff spots.  Arkansas went 1-4 vs playoff-bound teams.  Their only win was vs Texas, which is a critical win that would help propel them to one of the final playoff spots since they had no bad losses.  While the loss Toledo was not a deal-breaker, Northern Illinois went 1-1 vs playoff-bound teams, with their win vs Maryland leading them to one of the final playoff spots.  The final two spots were definitely tough to decide.  It came down to Clemson, Oregon, Missouri, Virginia Tech, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia.  
      <ul>
        <li>Clemson has the signature win vs ACC Champion Florida State as well as bad losses to NC State and Wake Forest.  </li>
        <li>Oregon has the signature win vs Big Ten Champion Michigan, but bad losses to Washington and Arizona State dents their resume as they do not have any other key wins.</li>
        <li>Missouri picked up a crucial win vs Nebraska, but also picked up bad losses to Kansas and Colorado. </li>
        <li>Virginia Tech was the only Big East team to beat Big East Champion Miami (FL), while also having bad losses to Boston College and Virginia. </li>
        <li>Pittsburgh does have a signature win to Virginia Tech, but it also has a bad loss to Notre Dame.</li>
        <li>West Virginia has the win vs Virginia Tech, but bad losses to Wisconsin and Cincinnati dents their resume, but they do have another win vs Pittsburgh that can help them.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Virginia Tech would pick up one of the final playoff spots.  Boston College and Virginia are both ranked within the Massey Composite Top 50, so Virginia Tech's losses to Virginia and Boston College were not as bad as the other teams' bad losses.  The final playoff spot went to Pittsburgh as they only had one bad loss to Notre Dame, while also picking up a win vs Virginia Tech.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Clemson's signature win vs ACC Champion Florida State was not enough to overcome the bad losses to NC State and Wake Forest.  Missouri's signature win vs Nebraska was not enough to overcome bad losses to Kansas and Colorado.  Oregon's signature win vs Big Ten Champion Michigan was not enough to overcome bad losses to Arizona State and Washington.  Finally, West Virginia's wins vs Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech were not enough to overcome bad losses to Wisconsin and Cincinnati.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another notable team that just fell out of the playoff picture was Toledo.  Toledo's bad losses to UNLV, Syracuse, and Ball State proved to be very costly.  They have wins vs Northern Illinois and Pittsburgh while also played close to Bowling Green.  However, their bad losses outweighed their wins vs Northern Illinois and Pittsburgh.
