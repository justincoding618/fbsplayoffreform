    <h1>2000-01 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2000 season was the third season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>While Oklahoma was the #1 ranked team, there were legit contenders for the #2 team in the country.  Florida State, Miami (FL), Washington, Virginia Tech, and Oregon State all had legitimate claims to play for a National Championship.  Florida State was the defending National Champion and Virginia Tech was the defending runner-up at the time.  However, Miami (FL) gave Florida State and Virginia Tech their only losses of the season.  Washington was able to give Miami (FL) and Oregon State their only losses of the season.  Despite their only losses to their respective opponents, Oregon State and Virginia Tech were not too far behind.</li>
        <li>Florida State was chosen as the #2 team over Miami (FL), Washington, Virginia Tech, and Oregon State.</li>
        <li>WAC Champion TCU (10-1) was overlooked.  Although TCU finished 14th in the BCS Standings, they were completely ignored for a potential at-large bid and were considered "weak" according to the computers.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 2000 season, the BCS at the time only ranked down to the lowest AQ team (which in most cases was the Top 15).  However, the BCS did go to the final top 16, as seen <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-los-angeles-times-bcs-mess-is-a-resu/136641992/">here</a>, which was enough to determine the National Seeds.  The Massey Composite Ratings does not have the full BCS rankings this time, so we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding.  Then, a combination of the AP Poll, <a href="https://masseyratings.com/ranks?s=cf&d=20001204">Massey Composite Ratings</a>, and merit-based selection was used to determine the rest of the field. The playoff matchups are based on the final regular season BCS and Massey Composite Ratings from 2000.

    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <p>
      The 2000 season marked the final season the Big West Conference sponsored football.  Boise State would clinch the Big West's final automatic bid before the Big West dropped football.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The ties were broken in three conferences.  The Big Ten and the Pac-10 both finished in a three-way tie for first place.  After the tie-breakers, Pac-10’s overall conference champion came down to the final rankings.  Washington, Oregon, and Oregon State were all ranked in the final BCS standings.  Washington was the highest ranked Pac-10 team, and would earn the Pac-10’s automatic bid.  Purdue, on the other hand, won the Big Ten title because of the head-to-head tie-breaker between Northwestern and Michigan.  They would earn the Big Ten’s automatic bid. When the BCS extended out to the top 16, Michigan was the highest ranked Big Ten team.  However, they lost the tie-breaker to Purdue.  TCU was the WAC co-champion and won the tie-breaker vs UTEP via head-to-head.
    </p>
    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      A combination of the final regular season BCS and AP Poll were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <p>
      With 9 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in either the BCS or AP Poll, 16 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This left us with five at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. Wisconsin was able to be safely in.  Despite their 2-4 record vs playoff-bound teams, their win vs Pac-10 co-champion Oregon as well as winning vs Western Michigan were enough to put them in while also not displaying any bad losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Western Michigan, they along with LSU, Mississippi State, and South Carolina claim the final at-large bids.  Western Michigan's loss in the MAC Championship to Marshall nearly costed them a spot in the playoffs. However, their win vs Marshall earlier in the regular season as well as a signature win vs Toledo propelled them to one of the final at-large spots despite their bad loss to Central Michigan.  Despite their bad loss to Arkansas, Mississippi State has a 2-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, with wins vs SEC Champion Florida and Auburn.  LSU also has a bad loss to Arkansas as well as a 2-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, with wins vs Tennessee and Mississippi State.  South Carolina had a bad loss to Alabama, but a 2-3 record vs playoff-bound teams, which included wins vs Mississippi State and Georgia.  For those three SEC teams, they were enough to gain the last at-large spots in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out did not have enough to be included in the field.  Ole Miss definitely had the most legitimate case to be included.  However, their bad loss to Alabama as well as Mississippi State just barely making the field and their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams were enough to put them out of the field.  Air Force almost made the playoff field.  However, their bad losses to UNLV and New Mexico cannot overcome their signature win vs Mountain West Champion Colorado State, placing Air Force on the wrong side of the fringe.  Iowa State had their best season in awhile.  However, their lack of wins vs playoff-bound teams led them to the wrong side of the fringe, being among the first teams out.  NC State also failed to pickup any wins vs playoff-bound teams as well picking up bad losses to Virginia and Maryland.
