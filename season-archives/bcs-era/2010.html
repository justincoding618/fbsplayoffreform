    <h1>2010-11 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2010 season was the thirteenth season of the BCS.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>Three teams finished an undefeated regular season. Auburn, Oregon, and TCU were among the top three teams.</li>
        <li>Auburn and Oregon were selected to play for a National Championship, leaving TCU behind due to their weak schedule, which continued to solidify the BCS's narrative that only power conference teams are more deserving to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>The BCS became a conversation topic for the government.  In May 2011, the U.S. Justice Department sent a letter to the NCAA asking for detailed explanation of why Division I FBS football was the only NCAA sport to not have a playoff and why the NCAA abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine a National Champion to an outside group.  These lawsuits were dropped when it became clear the BCS was moving to a playoff system a few years later.</li>
        <li>The Fiesta Bowl was caught in a scandal that involved not only the BCS's stifling of fair competition, but also fraud and tax evasion, placing the Fiesta Bowl's status as a prestigious bowl in jeopardy. The Fiesta Bowl Board of Directors immediately fired CEO John Junker (who later pleaded guilty to a felony charge) for his involvement with the scandal.  Two members of Junker's former staff pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges as well.  Junker was sentenced to 8 months in prison and 3 years of probation.  The BCS ultimately chose to keep the Fiesta Bowl in the lineup, fining the organization $1M for the scandal.</li>
        <li>The court could also order a resolution of the current unfair competition inherent in the BCS's structure, including ordering a playoff system and ordering the bowl games to participate.  Despite former Big Ten Commissioner Delaney's assertion that they would go back to the old system if the BCS folded, if a court ordered a solution, the conferences' hands would be forced.  They would have no choice but to do whatever the court says, including submitting to federal oversight of the Bowl's and Bowl teams' finances and administration, and conducting a 4, 8 or 16 team playoff, or whatever other remedy the court ordered.  The Department of Justice inquiry is far and away the most potentially dangerous legal situation that the BCS has faced to date.</li>
        <li>Ohio State was caught in Tattoogate with five players prior to the Sugar Bowl.  Although those five players were suspended for five games starting in the 2011 season, Ohio State and their five players were allowed to participate in the Sugar Bowl.  The scandal grew after Ohio State won the Sugar Bowl, resulting in Jim Tressel being forced out and Ohio State vacating all 12 of their wins to reduce their penalties.</li>
        <li>USC finished an 8-5 season, but was ineligible to play in the postseason due to NCAA penalties related to improper benefits to Reggie Bush.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2010 season marked the eighth season where the BCS ranked the top 25.
      Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

    <p>Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Michigan State all finished with a 7-1 conference record and were named Big Ten Co-Champions.  However, Ohio State and Michigan State did not face against each other.  The common opponents Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Michigan State played were Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Purdue.  This is how each of them fared:</p>

    <p>
      Wisconsin and Ohio State went 4-0 against them, while Michigan State went 3-1.  Wisconsin, therefore, would earn the Big Ten’s automatic bid to the playoffs due to their head-to-head tie-break over Ohio State.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big East had a three-way tie for first.  The tie-breakers went as follows:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Team</th>
          <th>Common Opponents</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>UConn</td>
          <td>2-0 vs West Virginia and Pittsburgh</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>West Virginia</td>
          <td>1-1 vs Pittsburgh and UConn</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pittsburgh</td>
          <td>0-2 vs UConn and West Virginia</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
  <p>
    UConn would win the tie-breaker due to the head-to-head sweep of West Virginia and Pittsburgh.  West Virginia would be second due to their head-to-head tie-break with Pittsburgh (and despite being ranked in the BCS), while Pittsburgh would finish third.  UConn would earn the Big East’s automatic bid.
  </p>
  <p>
    The WAC had a three-way tie for first.  Boise State, Nevada, and Hawaii all finished 7-1.  All of them were tied after head-to-head, and they all went undefeated against other conference foes.  The tie-break came down to the number of wins. Nevada had the most wins in the regular season at 12, while Boise had 11, and Hawaii had 10.  All were ranked in the final BCS top 25.  Nevada, therefore, would earn the WAC’s automatic bid to the playoffs due to having the greatest number of wins in a season.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Sun Belt, Troy and FIU shared the conference title. However, FIU would earn the automatic bid due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Troy.  The first-round matchups would then look like the following for the 2010 season (teams in bold are hosts):
  </p>  
  <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

    <p>The last teams in and the first teams out would have been the following:

          <th>Last Teams In</th>
          <th>First Teams Out</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Maryland (8-4)</td>
          <td>Air Force (8-4)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NC State (8-4)</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ohio (8-4)</td>
          <td>Northern Illinois (10-3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>San Diego St (8-4)</td>

    <p>
      With 8 of 11 conference champions being ranked in the BCS Standings, 17 out of the 21 at-large bids were taken by teams that were ranked in the final BCS Top 25.  This was enough for four at-large bids for teams that were not ranked in the BCS Top 25. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2010 fringe is one of the weakest.  There were not many teams left that have wins vs playoff-bound teams.  Maryland and NC State would gain two of the final four at-large bids.  NC State's bad losses to East Carolina and Clemson would have likely eliminated them from playoff contention without the win vs Florida State.  It was enough for them to claim one of the final playoff spots.  Maryland, on the other hand, needed NC State to make the playoff field to have a chance.  Because NC State did clinch one of the final at-large spots, Maryland get the next at-large spot as their win vs NC State was enough despite their bad losses to Miami (FL) and Clemson.  Ohio's win vs MAC Champion Miami (OH) was huge as their record vs playoff-bound teams improved to 1-1 despite the bad losses to Marshall and Kent State.  Ohio did just enough to put themselves as one of the last teams in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last playoff spot was very dicey as the best remaining teams do not have a win vs playoff-bound competition.  However, San Diego State gets the final playoff spot as although they were 0-3 vs playoff-bound teams, their win vs Air Force to get the head-to-head tie-breaker despite the bad loss to BYU was enough to propel them to the final playoff spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out all had legitimate cases but just fell short.  Navy's bad loss to Duke sticks out as they did not have any wins vs playoff-bound teams.  Northern Illinois picked up bad losses to Iowa State and Illinois and did not have the wins vs playoff-bound teams that can make up for those bad losses.  Air Force did not have any bad losses.  However, their 0-4 record vs playoff-bound teams placed them on the wrong side of the field.  Tulsa's bad losses to East Carolina and SMU plus lacking the wins vs playoff-bound teams that can make up for those bad losses was enough to put Tulsa on the wrong side of the fringe.
