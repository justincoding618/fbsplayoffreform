    <h1>2011-12 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 2011 season was the fourteenth season of the BCS.  It is also the first season of the Pac-10 rebranding to the Pac-12.  However, the following controversies happened:
      <ul>
        <li>LSU solidified itself to play for a National Championship.</li>
        <li>There was a debate between Alabama and Oklahoma State for who would play in the National Championship game.  Oklahoma State lost in double overtime at Iowa State (during the week where their women's head basketball coach and his assistant died in a plane crash), dropping them to 4th in the BCS and elevated Alabama to 2nd in the BCS.</li>
        <li>The National Championship game pitted LSU and Alabama for a rematch of their earlier regular season meeting.  Alabama went on to win the rematch.</li>
        <li>Because both LSU and Alabama played in the National Championship game, the Sugar Bowl could not pick another SEC team because no other SEC teams were eligible for BCS bids (the BCS still had a rule where conferences can only have up to two teams play in any BCS bowl game).</li>
        <li>The BCS continued overlooking non-power FBS teams, as Boise State (whose only loss was to TCU) was passed over for a BCS bowl.  Mountain West Champion TCU was also in contention for a BCS bowl, but was denied.</li>
        <li>Kansas State and Baylor were also passed over for a BCS bowl.  Instead, Virginia Tech and Michigan were selected to play in the Sugar Bowl. </li>
        <li>USC finished a 10-2 season, but was ineligible to play in the postseason due to NCAA penalties related to improper benefits to Reggie Bush.</li>
        <li>The call for a playoff finally reached its peak as inaction might result in government action, based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2011 season marked the ninth season where the BCS ranked the top 25. Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding, and then use the rest of the BCS and merit-based selection to determine the rest of the field. 
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
    <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
    <p>
    The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      The Big East had a three-way tie for first place.  West Virginia, Cincinnati, and Louisville were tied head-to-head.  In addition, they also tied due to common conference opponents.  The tie-breaker would then come down to the BCS rankings.  West Virginia wins the tie-breaker and wins the Big East’s automatic bid to the playoffs.  The first-round matchups would then look like the following for the 2011 season (teams in bold are hosts):

    <h3>At-Large Bids</h3>
    <p>
      The final regular season BCS standings were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      With 8 out of 11 conference champions ranked in the BCS Standings, we see that 17 out of the 21 at-large spots were claimed by teams ranked in the final regular season BCS Standings.  The 2011 BCS rankings produced an unusual situation where both Texas (7-5) and Auburn (7-5) were ranked in the final regular season standings at #24 and #25 respectively. This represents an outlier year where the depth of quality teams was significantly thinner than typical seasons.  While their records may seem unworthy of playoff consideration, my methodology uses the final BCS Top 25 rankings, so both teams would have received at-large bids to the 32-team field.   Auburn's was a bit justified as they played one of the tougher schedules in the country, picking up a critical win vs South Carolina.  Texas, on the other hand, lost all their contests to playoff-bound teams as well as Missouri.  However, the computers liked Texas enough to put them in the BCS Standings because of their critical win vs BYU.  There was enough at-large bids for the four best teams ranked outside of the BCS. Georgia Tech, Missouri, Notre Dame, and Virginia were the teams that have gotten the final at-large playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgia Tech's bad loss to Miami (FL) would have pushed them to the wrong side of the fringe without their win vs ACC Champion Clemson.  However, their win vs ACC Champion Clemson was enough to overcome the bad loss and gave them one of the final at-large spots.  Notre Dame's bad loss to South Florida looked like a deal-breaker in terms of their chances at one of the final at-large spots.  However, their 1-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, which included a win vs Michigan State, was enough to overcome the bad loss and gave them one of the final at-large spots.  Virginia was in a unique position, as their bad losses to NC State and North Carolina could have costed them a playoff spot.  However, with their win vs Georgia Tech (which made it in), it was just enough to push Virginia into one of the final playoff spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the depth of quality teams was significantly thinner than typical seasons, one more 7-5 team clinched the final playoff spot.  Missouri's 7-5 record may seem unworthy of playoff consideration.  However, their 1-4 record vs playoff-bound teams, with their one win against Texas, propelled them to the final playoff spot despite their bad loss to Arizona State.  Iowa became another notable 7-5 team that was in playoff consideration as well.  However, despite their signature win vs Michigan (which is the #13 seed in the 32-team field) earlier in the regular season, their bad losses vs Iowa State and Minnesota outweighed their resume, pushing them among the next teams out.  This fringe outlier benefitted the Big 12 because the fringe was so weak that their 7-5 teams could make it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same cannot be said for the first teams out.  BYU and Cincinnati produced impressive records.  However, both failed to win against playoff-bound competition (BYU is 0-2 vs playoff-bound teams, while Cincinnati also failed to pick up a win vs Big East Co-Champion West Virgina, who earned the Big East's automatic bid after being the higher ranked team).  While Rutgers picked up a critical win vs fellow fringe team Cincinnati, they fell on the wrong side of the fringe as they failed to win against playoff-bound competition as well as picking up bad losses to UConn, North Carolina, and Louisville.  Florida State was not able to secure opportunities vs playoff-bound teams, going 0-3 overall while also picking up a bad loss to Wake Forest.
