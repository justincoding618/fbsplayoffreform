    <h1>1998-99 FBS Playoffs</h1>
    <p>
      The 1998 season was the first season of the BCS.  However, the system ended in controversy.
      <ul>
        <li>The BCS put in six conference champions from the AQ conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10, and SEC), which left only two at-large spots for the BCS bowls.</li>
        <li>Kansas State (11-1) finished 3rd in the final BCS standings.  However, they were left out of the BCS bowl games.  Ohio State (10-1) and Florida (9-2) earned the only two at-large bids for the BCS games.  In the 1999 offseason, the BCS adopted the "Kansas State Rule", where the 3rd ranked team in the final BCS standings is assured an invitation to a BCS game.</li>
        <li>It also provided the first hint of inherent bias in the system.  CUSA Champion Tulane (11-0), WAC Champion Air Force (11-1), and MAC Champion Marshall (11-1) were all overlooked.  Although Tulane finished 10th in the BCS Standings, those non-FBS conference champions were completely ignored for a potential at-large bid and were considered "weak" according to the computers.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 1998 season, the BCS at the time only ranked down to the lowest AQ team (which in most cases was the Top 15).  Therefore, we used the final BCS Standings to determine National Seeding.  Then, a combination of the AP Poll, <a href="https://masseyratings.com/ranks?s=cf&d=19981207">Massey Composite Ratings</a>, and merit-based selection was used to determine the rest of the field. The playoff matchups are based on the final regular season BCS and Massey Composite Ratings from 1998.

      <h2>Qualifying Teams</h2>
      <h3>Automatic Bids</h3>
      <p>
      The automatic bids were given to teams that won the conference championship games.  However, if conferences do not hold conference championship games, the automatic bids were given to the regular season champion (after breaking all ties).

      A combination of the final regular season BCS and AP Poll were used to see which teams would have gotten the other at-large bids, while the combination of the Massey Composite Ratings and merit-based selection were used to determine the final at-large bids.

      Air Force was given the final National Seed as they had the highest Massey Composite Ratings of the remaining teams that were not ranked in the BCS.  Therefore, they would have gotten at least one home game in the playoffs.

    <p>The Last Teams in and the First Teams Out would have been the following:</p>

        <th>Last Teams In</th>
        <th>First Teams Out</th>

      With 8 out of 11 conference champions being ranked in either the BCS or AP Poll, 17 out of the 22 at-large bids were taken by teams that were either ranked in the final BCS Standings or the AP Poll.  This left us with five at-large bids for teams that were neither ranked in the BCS nor AP Poll. West Virginia pushed themselves as just safely in the field as their resume was the cleanest out of the five.  Their 1-3 record vs playoff-bound teams without any bad losses is how they were able to avoid being one of the last teams in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mississippi State, NC State, Texas Tech, and Virginia Tech claim the final at-large bids.  Mississippi State was in a danger zone after losing the SEC Championship game to Tennessee.  Their bad losses to Oklahoma State and LSU nearly denied them one of the last at-large playoff spots.  However, their win vs Arkansas propelled them to one of the final at-large spots.  NC State's bad losses to Baylor and North Carolina do stand out.  However, their 2-2 record vs playoff-bound teams, with their two biggest wins vs ACC Champion Florida State and Big East Champion Syracuse, propelled them to one of the final at-large spots.  Texas Tech's bad loss to Oklahoma would have eliminated them from the field if they did not pick up a critial win vs Texas.  However, because of that win vs Texas was just enough to put them as one of the final teams in.  Virigina Tech was on the verge of being one of the first teams out because of their bad loss to Temple.  However, their wins vs Miami (FL) and West Virginia were enough to put them in as one of the final teams to make it into the playoff field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first teams out definitely had cases.  However, they were not enough to be included in the field.  Purdue's best win was vs UCF.  However, their 0-4 record vs playoff-bound teams pushed them out of the field.  UCF's 9-2 record was impressive in their second year competing in the FBS.  However, their resume lacked wins vs playoff-bound teams, so they were among the first teams out.  The same goes for Miami (OH).  While their only loss was to MAC Champion Marshall, their resume also lacked wins vs playoff-bound teams.  Colorado was a team that nearly made it into the playoff field.  However, their win vs Texas Tech (who just barely made it into the field) was not enough to overcome their bad loss to Kansas.
