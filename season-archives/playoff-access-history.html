      <h1>NCAA Football Playoff Access: A Historical Perspective</h1>
      <p>
        One of the strongest arguments for a 32-team FBS playoff is the
        historical precedent set by every other NCAA football division. As each
        division's membership grew, playoff fields expanded proportionally to
        maintain reasonable access and balance between automatic qualifiers and
        at-large selections. If you want to learn more on how the football
        season operates in lower NCAA Divisions, you can visit

        The tables below show how playoff access evolved in relation to division
        size across FCS, Division II, and Division III—providing a comprehensive
        roadmap that FBS should follow.

      <h3>Division II's Unique Path: From All At-Large to Automatic Bids</h3>
      <p>
        Division II took a different approach than FCS and Division III,
        operating without automatic qualifier bids for most of its history:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1973-2003 (30 years):</b> All selections were at-large based on
          committee evaluation
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2004-2014 (Earned Access Model introduced):</b> Regional structure
          created; exact criteria unclear for early years
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2015-2024 (Modified Earned Access):</b> Conference champions ranked
          in the Top 9 of their super region earned bids, but still not
          guaranteed automatic qualifiers
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2025 (True Automatic Bids):</b> All 16 conference champions receive
          automatic bids + 16 at-large selections
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why Division II Expanded to 32 Teams in 2025</h4>
      <p>
        The expansion to 32 teams was
        <b
          >necessitated by the decision to award automatic bids to all
          conference champions</b
        >:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Division II has <b>16 conferences</b></li>
        <li>A 28-team field would provide: 16 autobids + only 12 at-large</li>
        <li>
          <b>NCAA policy consideration:</b> Maintaining adequate at-large
          opportunities alongside conference champion access
        </li>
        <li>
          The 32-team solution:
          <b>16 autobids + 16 at-large = perfect 1:1 ratio</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Division II's Playoff Access Evolution</h4>
      <p>
        The data shows a clear pattern of playoff access stabilizing around
        <b>16-20%</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1973-1987 (8 teams):</b> Access ranged from 4.57% to
          8.08%—inadequate
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1988-2003 (16 teams):</b> Access improved to 10.60-13.56%—better
          but still low
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2004-2014 (24 teams):</b> Access jumped to 14.04-16.55%—approaching
          ideal range
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2015-2024 (28 teams):</b> Access stabilized at 16.37-17.28%—good
          but tight with Earned Access
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2025 (32 teams):</b> Access now at 19.88%—healthy with true
          automatic bids
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Critical Lesson from Division II</h4>
      <p>
        Division II spent 52 years experimenting with different models before
        landing on the optimal solution in 2025:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They tried all at-large selection (didn't provide guaranteed
          conference access)
        </li>
        <li>
          They tried "Earned Access" (created arbitrary rankings thresholds)
        </li>
        <li>
          They finally adopted what works:
          <b
            >automatic bids for all conference champions + sufficient at-large
            opportunities</b
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b
          >With 161 teams and 16 conferences, Division II determined that 32
          teams (16 autobids + 16 at-large) was the right formula.</b
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Key Insight: Division III's Historical Pattern</h3>

          >as the division grew, playoff access percentage actually declined
          until they expanded the field.</b
        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1973-1984 (8-team era):</b> Access ranged from 2.09% to
          4.57%—absurdly low
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1985-1998 (16-team era):</b> Access improved to 7.48-9.20%—still

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1999-2004 (28-team era):</b> Access jumped to 12.07-12.73%—more
          reasonable; introduced automatic bids

        <li>
          <b>2005-2023 (32-team era):</b> Access stabilized at 12.80-13.79%

      <h4>The Automatic Bid Problem That Forced Expansion</h4>
      <p>
        Division III's expansion from 32 to 40 teams in 2024 was
        <b>mathematically necessary</b>. The data clearly shows how automatic
        bids gradually consumed the entire playoff field:

          <b>27-28 automatic bids</b> (28 starting in 2026 when NESCAC begins

        Notice how Division III took
        <b>51 years to reach 16.6% playoff access</b> after starting at just

        division grew and as conferences multiplied.

      <h2>Key Insights Across All NCAA Divisions</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The 8-team format was universally unstable:</b> FCS tried it for
          exactly one season (1981) before recognizing it was insufficient.
          Division II used it for 15 years with access as low as 4.57%. Division
          III used it for 10 years with access as low as 3.77%. No division
          found 8 teams sustainable.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The 16-20% range appears to be the NCAA standard:</b> When FCS,
          Division II, and Division III independently determined their optimal
          playoff sizes, they all converged on providing roughly 16-20% of teams
          with playoff access.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Division size matters:</b> Division II (161 teams) determined 32
          teams was optimal. Division III (241 teams) determined 40 teams was
          optimal. The larger the division, the larger the playoff field needed.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Every division expanded as it grew:</b> The historical pattern is
          clear: as divisions add teams, playoff fields expand proportionally to
          maintain reasonable access.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The autobid squeeze is real and predictable:</b> Division III's
          detailed data shows how automatic bids naturally grow over time as
          conferences form and stabilize. By 2023, they had a 7:1 ratio of
          autobids to at-large (28 to 4), forcing expansion to 40 teams.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b
            >Division II's 52-year journey proves comprehensive solutions
            work:</b
          >
          After trying all at-large (32 years) and "Earned Access" models (20
          years), Division II finally adopted automatic bids for all conference
          champions in 2025. They expanded to 32 teams to accommodate 16
          autobids + 16 at-large.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What This Means for FBS</h2>

      <p>
        Now that we've examined the complete history of playoff expansion across
        FCS, Division II, and Division III, we can apply these lessons to FBS.

      </table>

      <h3>The Evidence Is Clear</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>FBS has the worst playoff access in NCAA football:</b> At 8.8%, FBS
          provides less access than FCS (18.6%), Division II (19.9%), or
          Division III (16.6%). FBS is the only division with single-digit
          playoff access.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>FBS is an outlier:</b> Every other division has converged on 16-20%
          playoff access as sustainable. FBS at 8.8% is dramatically below this
          proven standard.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Division II just proved 32 teams works:</b> With 161 teams and 16
          conferences, Division II determined that 32 teams (16 autobids + 16
          at-large) was the right formula in 2025.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>FBS proportionally needs at least 25-27 teams:</b> If FBS adopted
          the same 18.6-19.9% playoff access rate that FCS and Division II have
          proven sustainable, the playoff would need 25-27 teams minimum.
          Although playoff access would be more generous, a 32-team field (23.5%
          access) is well-justified by NCAA precedent.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b
            >My 32-team proposal has a better autobid-to-at-large ratio than
            Division II:</b
          >
          <ul>
            <li>Division II: 1:1 ratio (16 autobids, 16 at-large)</li>
            <li>Division III: 2.3:1 ratio (28 autobids, 12 at-large)</li>
            <li><b>FBS Proposal: 1:2.2 ratio (10 autobids, 22 at-large)</b></li>
            <li>
              This means FBS would have proportionally MORE at-large
              opportunities for merit selection than any other division
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>FBS is growing but playoff access is shrinking:</b> FBS went from
          134 teams (9.0% access) in 2024 to 136 teams (8.8% access) in 2025.
          The problem is getting worse, not better.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b
            >A 16-team FBS playoff would face the same squeeze Division III
            escaped:</b
          >
          <ul>
            <li>FBS has 10 conferences</li>
            <li>
              SEC's 16-team proposal: 5 autobids + 11 at-large (which 5
              conferences get autobids?)
            </li>
            <li>
              If all 10 conferences got autobids in a 16-team field: 10 autobids
              + only 6 at-large
            </li>
            <li>
              With 136 teams, having only 6 at-large spots creates the same
              squeeze Division III faced with their 7:1 ratio
            </li>
            <li>
              Power conferences would (correctly) argue their depth deserves
              more at-large opportunities
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >FBS should not repeat the mistakes of Division II (52 years of
          experimentation) or Division III (51 years to get it right). The
          evidence from every other NCAA football division points to the same
          conclusion: with 136 teams and 10 conferences, 32 teams is the right
          size for FBS.</b

      <p>
        The real question isn't "Why 32 teams?"—it's
        <b
          >"Why would the largest and most prominent division provide worse
          playoff access than Division I FCS, Division II, and Division III?"</b
