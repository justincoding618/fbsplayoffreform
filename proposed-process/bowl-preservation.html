      <h1>New Year's Six Bowl Games</h1>
      <p>Let's start with the obvious one.  The New Year's Six Bowl Games are not going to go away anytime soon.  They would continue to become hosts for the quarterfinal and semifinal games.      
      </p>
      <p>
        Preserving the New Year's Six Bowl Games will continue to keep these bowl games relevant.  They can either go in a 3-Year, 4-Year, or a 5-Year Cycle.  However, what all the cycles have in common is that the Rose Bowl will become a permanent semifinal game, while the remaining New Year's Six bowl games would either rotate as a semifinal and quarterfinal site or become permanent quarterfinal site. Here is how they would function: 
        <div id="ny6table"></div>
      </p>
      </p>
        In Version A of the 3-Year Cycle, the rotation would have the semifinal rotation be similar to the BCS bowl rotation.  The Rose Bowl would become an annual semifinal game, while the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl would rotate in a 3-year cycle to host the other semifinal game.  The Cotton Bowl and Peach Bowl would become permanent quarterfinal games.
      </p>
      </p>
        In Version B of the 3-Year Cycle, the rotation would have the semifinal rotation be similar to the 1937 major bowl rotation.  While the Rose Bowl would still become an annual semifinal game, the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Cotton Bowl would rotate in a 3-year cycle to host the other semifinal game.  The Peach Bowl and Fiesta Bowl would become permanent quarterfinal games.
      </p>
      </p>
        In the 4-Year Cycle, the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl and Fiesta Bowl would rotate to host the other semifinal game.  Those four bowl games would also be guaranteed to host the quarterfinals on years when they do not host the semifinals.  The Peach Bowl would become a permanent quarterfinal game.   
      </p>
      </p>
        Finally, the 5-year cycle would have Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Peach Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl rotating to host the other semifinal game.  All of those bowl games would also be guaranteed to host the quarterfinals on years when they do not host the semifinals. 
      </p>
      <h1>Preserving the Remaining Bowls</h1>
      <p>
        With the proposal of the 32-team playoff, you will likely ask whether bowl games are going to be eliminated. As long as the sponsors and city hosts have the money and the NCAA accepts more bowl proposals, bowl games will continue to exist.  Money is a significant factor into making these bowl games and the current system happen.  However, with the expansion of the College Football Playoff, I do think the bowl system is on life support.  Players know that when their team doesn’t make the playoffs, some of them completely sit out of them because of the following reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>Preparing for the NFL Draft</li>
          <li>Transfer portal</li>
          <li>Injury Risk</li>
          <li>Worthless postseason stakes</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, there are also teams who decided to opt out of playing in a bowl game.  In the 2025 season, ten teams have declined to participate in a bowl game.  The most notable one is Notre Dame, who decided to not participate in a bowl game after being the first team out of the CFP.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Viewership is as important as revenue.  In addition, not all football stadiums fill all their seats in all bowl games.  You also have to consider the student welfare and the validity of these bowl games, such as the articles from time.com explaining why students are the biggest losers in bowl games and forbes.com explaining if bowl games are outgrowing themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, sponsors and cities will be unable to sponsor and host bowl games much longer.  When that time happens, bowl games will become extinct.  However, the New Year’s Six Bowl Games will survive as long as they continually host the Quarterfinal and Semifinal games.  For the rest, if bowl games want to prevent extinction, they will have to find a new sponsor and/or have to move to a new location that will fund and support the bowl game.  
      </p>
      <h2>Why We Should Implement Consolation Bowl Games</h2>
      <p>
        If the bowl games were to continue to coexist with the playoffs, they will need to be part of the consolation prize to teams eliminated from the new FBS championship playoffs.  However, with the New Year’s Six Bowl Games as quarterfinal and semifinal games, 33 bowl games would remain currently (the LA Bowl and GameAbove Sports Bowl has recently discontinued).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what the overall postseason composition would have looked like without implementing the consolation bowl games for eliminated playoff participants:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Total</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
              <th>Composition</th>
              <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>98</td>
              <td>136</td>
              <td>72.1%</td>
              <td>
                32 Teams to the FBS Playoffs <br/>
                66 Teams to Bowl Games
              </td>
              <td>64 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the CFP decides to not implement consolation bowl games for eliminated playoff participants,  we would increase the selection percentage to 72.1% because after selecting those 32 teams to the FBS playoffs, we would have about 50 bowl eligible teams remaining.  That means that at least 16 more teams with losing records would be invited to play in bowl games.  Basically, you would be inviting more teams with losing records to play in bowl games, which is not ideal.  Here is a further breakdown if you are curious:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Postseason</th>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>FBS Playoffs</td>
              <td>32 Teams</td>
              <td>31 Playoff Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bowl Games</td>
              <td>66 Teams</td>
              <td>33 Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Total</td>
              <td>98 Teams</td>
              <td>64 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, both the quality of the remaining bowl games as well as the quality pool of bowl eligible teams would significantly decline as a result of expanding the playoff without implementing consolation bowl games for playoff participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coexistence between 32-team FBS playoffs and bowl games can happen.  If bowl games do not become part of the consolation packages for eliminated FBS playoff participants, then we would need to do either or all of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce the number of bowl games available for teams that do not make the playoffs. </li>
            <li>Incorporate the remaining bowl games in a secondary playoff system.  I explain more on this in <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/supplements/secondary-playoffs.html">the secondary playoff system</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to present my main solution to incorporate bowl games for eliminated playoff participants.
        </p>
        <h2>The Main Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The main solution is to incorporate the top four Non-New Year's Six Bowl games as consoltion bowl games for eliminated second round participants.  The reason I want to put it this way is because I want to keep the first round as very high stakes.  These would be the following bowl games that would accept teams eliminated in the second round:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th colspan="2">
                <center>
                  Second Round Participants
                </center>
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Citrus Bowl</td>
              <td>Holiday Bowl</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Alamo Bowl</td>
              <td>ReliaQuest Bowl</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          This would mean that teams eliminated in the first round would have their seasons end.  On the other hand, this would make the incentive for teams to have to win in the first round if they want to at least play in a bowl game.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, even if we only implement this solution, we would still have a very high selection of teams participating in either the 32-team field or bowl game.  This is what the overall postseason composition would have looked like if we only implement consolation bowl games for second round participants:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Total</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
              <th>Composition</th>
              <th>Number of Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>90</td>
              <td>136</td>
              <td>66.2%</td>
              <td>
                32 Teams to the FBS Playoffs <br/>
                58 Teams to Bowl Games
              </td>
              <td>64 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          After selecting those 32 teams to the FBS playoffs, we would still have about 50 bowl eligible teams remaining.  That means that at least 8 more teams with losing records would be invited to play in bowl games.  Although this is not as bad, you would still be inviting teams with losing records.  Here is a further breakdown if you are curious:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Postseason</th>
              <th>Selected</th>
              <th>Postseason Games</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>FBS Playoffs</td>
              <td>32 Teams</td>
              <td>31 Playoff Games + 4 Consolation Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bowl Games</td>
              <td>58 Teams</td>
              <td>29 Bowl Games</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Total</td>
              <td>90 Teams</td>
              <td>64 Postseason Games</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of postseason games would still remain the same.  While we would still be able to retain a high quality of the top four non-New Year’s Six Bowl Games (based on revenue distribution), the quality of the remaining bowl games and the quality pool of bowl eligible teams would still decline. This is where I present the second part of the solution, which is <b>implementing the secondary playoff system.</b>  You can read more on this in the <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/supplements/secondary-playoffs.html">secondary playoff system solution</a>.  However, you would still also have the chance of players deciding to sit out of the bowl games after being eliminated from the FBS playoffs.
