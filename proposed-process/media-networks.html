      <h1>Proposed Media Networks</h1>
      <h2>Why Multi-Network Distribution Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Distributing playoff games across multiple networks maximizes revenue for schools and conferences while ensuring broad fan access regardless of cable provider or streaming service. A 32-team playoff generates 31 games across five rounds, which is far more inventory than any single network could handle. By partnering with ESPN/ABC, TNT Sports, FOX, CBS, NBC, and their streaming platforms, the playoff reaches the widest possible audience and creates competitive bidding that drives up rights fees. This model mirrors the NFL's approach, which has proven enormously successful in maximizing both revenue and viewership.
      </p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The TV Networks/streaming platforms would have an NFL-like feel.  The proposed networks and streaming services are the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary Network</th>
            <th>Streaming Partners</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ESPN/ABC</td>
            <td>ESPN DTC</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>FOX</td>
            <td>FOX One</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>CBS</td>
            <td>Paramount+</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NBC</td>
            <td>Peacock</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <center><small>DTC = Direct-to-Consumer</small></center>
      </p>
      <p>
        For TV Networks and streaming, the distribution would depend on whether the quarterfinal and semifinal rotation is a 3-year, 4-year, or 5-year cycle.  Let's look at each of the scenarios.
      </p>
      <h2>3-Year Cycle</h2>
      <p>
        If the rotation is only a 3-year cycle, here is the breakdown of how many first-round games each of the proposed networks would air/stream and when they would air them:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Year A</th>
            <th>Year B</th>
            <th>Year C</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC</td>
            <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
            <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
            <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>FOX/FOX One</td>
            <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>CBS/Paramount+</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NBC/Peacock</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC would have four first round games.  FOX/FOX One, CBS/Paramount+, and NBC/Peacock would rotate in a 3-year cycle to air one Friday first round game and three Saturday first round games depending on who is airing the other semifinal game.  For example, if FOX is airing the semifinals alongside ESPN/ABC, FOX would have ir one Friday first round game and three Saturday first round games, while CBS and NBC would air two first round games on Wednesday and two first round games on Saturday.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, ESPN/ABC, FOX, CBS, and NBC can work out the rest of the second-round games. 
        Here is the breakdown of how many second-round games each of the proposed networks would air/stream: 
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Year A</th>
            <th>Year B</th>
            <th>Year C</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC</td>
            <td>2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>FOX/FOX One</td>
            <td>2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>1 on Wednesday, 1 on Friday</td>
            <td>1 on Wednesday, 1 on Friday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>CBS/Paramount+</td>
            <td>1 on Wednesday, 1 on Friday</td>
            <td>2 on Saturday</td>
            <td>1 on Wednesday, 1 on Friday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NBC/Peacock</td>
            <td>1 on Wednesday, 1 on Friday</td>
            <td>1 on Wednesday, 1 on Friday</td>
            <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see for both scenarios, FOX, CBS, and NBC would rotate to are the other two Saturday games depending on which network is airing the other semifinal game.  For example, if FOX is airing the other semifinal game that year, they would also gain a Saturday double-header, while CBS and NBC would each air one Wednesday and one Friday game.
      </p>
      <p>
        ESPN/ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX would each air one quarterfinal game.  ESPN/ABC would still have the rights to air the Rose Bowl game every year.  The other semifinal game would be rotated between FOX, CBS, and NBC.  ESPN/ABC would have permanent rights to air the National Championship Game.  Because there are two versions, here is how the two different versions would happen with the quarterfinals and semifinals:
      </p>

        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting it all together, here is how the media rotation is going to go:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Year</th>
            <th>Media Coverage for First Two Rounds</th>
            <th>Final Three Round Coverage</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Year A</td>
            <td>Version A</td>
            <td>
              Quarterfinals: One Each on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, CBS/Paramount+, FOX/FOX One, and NBC/Peacock<br/>
              Semifinals: Both on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC<br/>
              National Championship: ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC<br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Year B</td>
            <td>Version B</td>

              Semifinals: One on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC and One on CBS/Paramount+<br/>
              National Championship: ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC<br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Year C</td>

            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Year D</td>
            <td>Version D</td>
            <td>
              Quarterfinals: One Each on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, CBS/Paramount+, FOX/FOX One, and NBC/Peacock<br/>
              Semifinals: One on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC and One on NBC/Peacock<br/>
              National Championship: NBC/Peacock<br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Year E</td>
            <td>Version A or B</td>
            <td>
              If Version A: <br/>
              Quarterfinals: One Each on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, CBS/Paramount+, FOX/FOX One, and NBC/Peacock<br/>
              If Fiesta Bowl on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC: Rose Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and National Championship all ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC<br/>
              If Fiesta Bowl on FOX/FOX One: Rose Bowl on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, Fiesta Bowl on FOX/FOX One, and National Championship on FOX/FOX One<br/>
              If Version B: <br/>
              Quarterfinals: One Each on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, CBS/Paramount+, FOX/FOX One, and NBC/Peacock<br/>
              If Fiesta Bowl on CBS/Paramount+: Rose Bowl on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, Fiesta Bowl on CBS/Paramount+, and National Championship on CBS/Paramount+ <br/>
              If Fiesta Bowl on FOX/FOX One: Rose Bowl on ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC, Fiesta Bowl on NBC/Peacock, and National Championship on NBC/Peacock<br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Year E becomes a flex year.  It will all depend on which network gets the Fiesta Bowl that year.   For example, if ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC get the Fiesta Bowl, we would utilize Version A media coverage for the first two rounds and ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC would also gain the right to air the National Championship Game that year.
      </p>
      <h2>Additional Media Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        The following networks and streaming platforms would also provide different views and/or commentaries during the final three rounds depending on the main public network:
        <table>

            <th>Sublicense</th>
            <th>Secondary Channels</th>

            <td>Peacock</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h2>Consolation Bowl Games</h2>
      <p>
        The consolation bowl games for second round playoff participants would kick off on the following TV Networks/streaming:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Bowl Game</th>
            <th>TV Network</th>
            <th>Streaming</th>

          <tr>
            <td>Citrus Bowl</td>
            <td>ABC</td>
            <td>ESPN DTC</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Alamo Bowl</td>
            <td>ESPN or CBS</td>
            <td>ESPN DTC or Paramount+</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ReliaQuest Bowl</td>
            <td>NBC</td>
            <td>Peacock</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Holiday Bowl</td>
            <td>FOX</td>
            <td>FOX One</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        ESPN/ESPN DTC and CBS/Paramount+ would alternate airing the Alamo Bowl.  For example, ESPN/ESPN DTC would air the Alamo Bowl in odd years, while CBS/Paramount+ would air the Alamo Bowl in even years.
