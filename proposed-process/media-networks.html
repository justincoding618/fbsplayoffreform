    <h1>Proposed Media Networks</h1>
    <h2>Why Multi-Network Distribution Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Distributing playoff games across multiple networks maximizes revenue for schools and conferences while ensuring broad fan access regardless of cable provider or streaming service. A 32-team playoff generates 31 games across five rounds, which is far more inventory than any single network could handle. By partnering with ESPN/ABC, TNT Sports, FOX, CBS, NBC, and their streaming platforms, the playoff reaches the widest possible audience and creates competitive bidding that drives up rights fees. This model mirrors the NFL's approach, which has proven enormously successful in maximizing both revenue and viewership.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The TV Networks/streaming platforms would have an NFL-like feel.  The proposed networks and streaming services are the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Primary Network</th>
          <th>Sublicense</th>
          <th>Streaming Partners</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ESPN/ABC</td>
          <td>TNT Sports (TNT/TBS/TruTV)</td>
          <td>ESPN DTC, HBO Max</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOX</td>
          <td>None</td>
          <td>FOX One</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>CBS</td>
          <td>None</td>
          <td>Paramount+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NBC</td>
          <td>None</td>
          <td>Peacock</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    </p>
    <p>
      For TV Networks and streaming, the distribution would depend on whether the quarterfinal and semifinal rotation is a 3-year, 4-year, or 5-year cycle.  Let's look at each of the scenarios.
    </p>
    <h2>3-Year Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      If the rotation is only a 3-year cycle, here is the breakdown of how many first-round games each of the proposed networks would air/stream and when they would air them:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Year A</th>
          <th>Year B</th>
          <th>Year C</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC</td>
          <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TNT Sports/HBO Max</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday, 2 on Saturday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOX/FOX One</td>
          <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>CBS/Paramount+</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NBC/Peacock</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday, 3 on Saturday</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC would have four first round games.  ESPN would then sublicense four more first round games to TNT Sports/HBO Max.  FOX/FOX One, CBS/Paramount+, and NBC/Peacock would rotate in a 3-year cycle to air four first round games depending on who is airing the other semifinal game.  For example, if FOX is airing the semifinals alongside ESPN/ABC, FOX would have four first round games, while CBS and NBC would air two first round games each.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, ESPN/ABC, FOX, CBS, and NBC can work out the rest of the second-round games. 
      Here is the breakdown of how many second-round games each of the proposed networks would air/stream: 
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Year A</th>
          <th>Year B</th>
          <th>Year C</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ESPN/ABC/ESPN DTC</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TNT Sports/HBO Max</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday</td>
          <td>2 on Wednesday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOX/FOX One</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>CBS/Paramount+</td>
          <td>1 on Friday</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NBC/Peacock</td>
          <td>1 on Friday</td>
          <td>1 on Friday</td>
          <td>2 on Saturday</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see for both scenarios, FOX, CBS, and NBC would rotate to are the other two Saturday games depending on which network is airing the other semifinal game.  For example, if FOX is airing the other semifinal game that year, they would also gain a Saturday double-header.
    </p>
    <p>
      ESPN/ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX would each air one quarterfinal game.  ESPN/ABC would still have the rights to air the Rose Bowl game every year.  The other semifinal game would be rotated between FOX, CBS, and NBC.  ESPN/ABC would have permanent rights to air the National Championship Game.  Because there are two versions, here is how the two different versions would happen with the quarterfinals and semifinals:
    </p>
    <p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>New Year's Six Bowl</th>

          <th>3-Year Rotation Version B</th>

    <h2>4-Year Cycle</h2>

      If the rotation is a 4-year cycle, it would feel similar to the Super Bowl rotation.  Here is how the media coverage would tackle the first round:

      ESPN/ABC this time would air two quarterfinal games, while the other two quarterfinal games would be rotated between CBS, NBC, FOX and TNT Sports.  ABC/ESPN would still have the right to air the Rose Bowl game every year.  The other semifinal game would be rotated between ESPN/ABC, FOX, CBS, NBC, and TNT Sports.  ESPN/ABC, FOX, CBS, and NBC would still rotate to air the CFP National Championship Game.  Putting it all together, this is what each TV Network would have when they are in rotation:
