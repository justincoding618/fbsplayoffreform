      <h1>Kickoff Dates and Times</h1>
      <h2>Why Scheduling Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Scheduling 31 playoff games across five rounds while avoiding NFL conflicts and ensuring fair rest periods for all teams requires careful planning. Unlike the current 12-team playoff, a 32-team format must coordinate games across multiple days and weeks while maintaining competitive balance. Regardless of playing games on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday, teams need adequate rest before their next game, and no team should gain an unfair advantage simply because of when their game was scheduled.
      </p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        We are going to breakdown the proposed kickoff dates and times for each
        playoff round. The distribution of TV Networks/streaming networks through
        the five playoff rounds can be found
        <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/proposed-process/media-networks.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>First Two Rounds</h2>
      <p>
        The first round would go as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Four First Round Games on Wednesday Night</li>
          <li>Two First Round Games on Friday Night</li>
          <li>Ten First Round Games on Saturday</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>The kickoff dates and times for the first-round games would then be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>First Round</th>
            <th>Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 1-4</td>
            <td rowspan="2">
              5:30PM and 9PM<br/>
              6PM and 9:30PM<br/>
              6:30PM and 10PM<br/>
              OR <br/>
              7PM and 10:30PM<br/>
            </td>
            <td>Wed. Nov. 28 - Dec. 4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 5 and 6</td>
            <td>Fri. Nov. 30 - Dec. 6</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Games 7-16</td>
            <td>Some at 12PM</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Sat. Dec. 1 - 7</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Some at 3:30PM and/or 4PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Some at 7:30PM and/or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second round would go as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Two Second Round Games on Wednesday Night</li>
          <li>Two Second Round Games on Friday Night</li>
          <li>Four Second Round Games on Saturday</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>The kickoff dates and times for the second-round games would then be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Second Round</th>
            <th>Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 1 and 2</td>
            <td rowspan="2">
              5:30PM and 9PM<br/>
              6PM and 9:30PM<br/>
              6:30PM and 10PM<br/>
              OR <br/>
              7PM and 10:30PM<br/>
            </td>
            <td>Wed. Dec. 5 - 11</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 3 and 4</td>

            <td>Fri. Dec. 7 - 13</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Games 5-8</td>
            <td>
              11AM, 2:30PM, 6PM and 9:30PM<br/>
              OR <br/>
              12PM, 3:30PM, 7PM, and 10:30PM<br/>
            </td>
            <td>Sat. Dec. 8 - 14</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
      For the second round, the later pairings are only possible if the following happens:
        <ul>
          <li>At least one team seeded 1-8 from the Pacific and/or Mountain Time Zone advance to the second round</li>
          <li>At least one team seeded 9-16 from the Pacific and/or Mountain Time Zone advance and is paired with an unseeded team in the second round</li>
          <li>A pair of unseeded teams, where one of them is from Pacific and/or Mountain Time Zone; if the unseeded team from Pacific and/or Mountain Time is higher ranked, they would be the designated host</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if there are no teams from Pacific and/or Mountain Time advancing to the second round, then for the Wednesday and Friday kickoffs, either Pair 1 or 2 would apply.  For Saturday, the first pairing would apply.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For both the first and second round games, we’re going to need to do them to a point where at least one team does not have a rest advantage/disadvantage.  For teams playing on one of the four Wednesday Night games in the first round, the advancing teams’ next game would happen on Wednesday Night the next week.  In addition, each first round game would need to be in pairs of the adjacent seeds.  For the following examples:
        <ul>
          <li>If the 8 seed plays an unseeded team on Wednesday Night, then the 9 seed and their unseeded pair would also play on that Wednesday Night.</li>
          <li>If the 7 seed plays an unseeded team on Wednesday Night, then the 10 seed and their unseeded pair would also play on that Wednesday Night. </li>
          <li>The winners of those games would play on Wednesday Night the next week.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The same would apply to the two Friday Night first round games.  For the following examples:
        <ul>
          <li>If the 6 seed plays an unseeded team on Friday Night, then the 11 seed and their unseeded pair would also play on that Friday Night.  </li>
          <li>The winners of those games would play on Friday Night the next week. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the rest of the teams playing on Saturday, their earliest game they would play for the winning teams is Friday Night the next week.  In this way, there would be no less than six days between games. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason no playoff game would air on Thursday Night is because the NFL has Thursday Night games every year from the Thursday after Labor Day up until the penultimate week of the regular season (there is no Thursday Night game during the regular season finale).  
      </p>
      
      <h2>Final Three Rounds</h2>
      <p>
        The kickoff times to the quarterfinal round would look like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Quarterfinal</th>
            <th>Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Kickoff Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 1</td>
            <td>12PM</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Fri. Dec. 14 - 20</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 2</td>
            <td>4PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 3</td>
            <td>8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game 4</td>
            <td>12PM or 8PM</td>
            <td>Sat. Dec. 15 - 21</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        The NFL has a no Saturday games policy from the Saturday after Labor Day to the second Saturday of December.  Because the NFL would have the incentive to air those Saturday games beginning the third weekend of December, three of the four kickoff times would happen on Friday to avoid viewer competition with the NFL.  The Saturday kickoff would depend on whether the NFL has a doubleheader all in the afternoon or late afternoon and evening.  For either scenario, the kickoff time would be the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>NFL Saturday Doubleheader Kickoff Times (in EST)</th>
            <th>QF Saturday Kickoff Time (in EST)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1PM and 4:30PM</td>
            <td>8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4:30PM and 8PM</td>
            <td>12PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        The kickoff times for the semifinal and national championship game would depend on the NFL.  If the NFL does eventually expand to an 18-game schedule and is flexible enough to move their two Saturday regular-season finale games to afternoon only (with 1PM and 4:30PM EST kickoff times) or if New Year’s Day falls on a Friday or Saturday, only air two Saturday late-regular season games on the second Saturday of January in the afternoon slot, the kickoff for the final two rounds would look like the following (in ET):
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>New Year's Falls on</th>
            <th>Rose Bowl Kickoff Date and Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Rotating Semfinal Kickoff Date and Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sunday</td>
            <td>Jan. 2 at 5PM</td>
            <td>Jan. 1 at 1PM</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan 14 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Monday</td>
            <td rowspan="6">Jan. 1 at 4PM</td>
            <td rowspan="6">Jan. 1 at 8PM</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan. 13 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tuesday</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan. 12 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Wednesday</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan. 11 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Thursday</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan. 10 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Friday</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan. 9 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Saturday</td>
            <td>Sat. Jan. 8 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the NFL continues their status quo, the kickoff for the final two rounds would look like the following (in ET):
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>New Year's Falls on</th>
            <th>Rose Bowl Kickoff Date and Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>Rotating Semfinal Kickoff Date and Time (in EST)</th>
            <th>National Championship Game Date</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sunday</td>
            <td>Jan. 2 at 5PM</td>
            <td>Jan. 1 at 1PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 13 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Monday</td>
            <td rowspan="6">Jan. 1 at 4PM</td>
            <td rowspan="6">Jan. 1 at 8PM</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 12 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tuesday</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 11 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Wednesday</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 10 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Thursday</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 9 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Friday</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 8 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Saturday</td>
            <td>Fri. Jan 14 7:30PM or 8PM</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the Rose Bowl would be an annual semifinal game, the semifinals would kick off on Jan. 1 every year (Jan. 2 if New Year’s falls on a Sunday).  The National Championship game would kick off on a Friday Night (or Saturday Night if schedule allows). 
      </p>  
      <h2>Consolation Bowl Games</h2>
      <p>
        Since the consolation bowl games would be implemented for second round playoff participants, the kickoff dates and times would look like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>New Year's Day Falls On</th>
            <th>Citrus Bowl</th>
            <th>Alamo Bowl</th>
            <th>ReliaQuest Bowl</th>
            <th>Holiday Bowl</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sunday</td>
            <td>Dec. 31 3:30PM EST</td>
            <td>Dec. 31 7:30PM EST</td>
            <td>Dec. 31 12PM EST</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 8PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Monday</td>
            <td rowspan="6">Jan. 1 12PM EST</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 4PM EST</td>
            <td>Dec. 30 12PM EST</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Dec. 29 8PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tuesday</td>
            <td rowspan="5">Dec. 31 3:30PM EST</td>
            <td rowspan="5">Dec. 31 12PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Wednesday</td>
            <td rowspan="4">Dec. 30 8PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Thursday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Friday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Saturday</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest advantage to this schedule is that we don’t really have to worry about the NFL.   However, you’ll notice that there is more flexibility to have a Friday Night National Championship Game kickoff than doing a Monday Night kickoff.  This is because with the current NFL season, in certain years, the NFL would have a wildcard game on a Monday Night game when Jan. 12-18 falls on a Monday.  In addition, the FCS Championship game has used Monday Night kickoffs since the 2024 season.  When New Year’s Day falls on Sunday or Monday, the FCS Championship game would utilize the second Monday of January.  Because of this, only the Friday Night kickoffs would have been good enough.  Overall, this schedule is much better than having to potentially start on the second weekend of December and concluding well into January.
