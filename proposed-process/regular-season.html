      <h1>Regular Season</h1>
      <p>
        Understanding the proposed regular season structure requires first examining how the current system works and why it needs reform. Here's the current college football regular season schedule:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
            <th>Opening Weekend</th>
            <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
            <th>Conference Championship Game</th>
            <th>Army-Navy</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">12</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Weekend of Sept. 1-5</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Thanksgiving Weekend</td>
            <td rowspan="3">First Weekend of December</td>
            <td rowspan="3">Dec. 8 - 14 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Weekend of Aug. 23-31</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>1</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>By proposing the 32-team playoff field, we would have to adjust the regular season.  The regular season is going to depend on how the latest realignment wave is going to play out.  The biggest questions that would come with the transition would be the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Should FBS conferences continue to enforce conference championship games?</li>
          <li>How would conference champions be determined if conferences decide to no longer hold conference championship games?</li>
          <li>How would Army and Navy hold their annual rivalry since they usually play their game in December?</li>
          <li>Would every FBS conference need to schedule early in order to play more games?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the inclusion of the 12-team playoff field, conference championship games are becoming meaningless.  Sure, an extra game to win a conference title can help to potentially propel a team to a playoff berth.  However, it really means less in certain conferences, especially when the conference runner-up and conference champion can potentially both make it to the playoffs.  
      </p>
      <h2>Conference Championships</h2>
      <p>
        Given the nature of an expanded playoff field, not many conferences administer conference championship games.  In Division I FCS, only the SWAC continues to administer the conference championship game.  The winner of the SWAC Championship Game would play in the Celebration Bowl against the MEAC Champion, which serves as the HBCU National Championship.  Division II only has three conferences continuing to run the conference championship games.  Finally, Division III only has one conference (SCIAC) managing championship weekend (with the top division winners playing for a conference title and other teams playing their assigned crossover divisional opponents depending on their divisional standings).  
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Recommended Approach: Eliminate conference championship games.</b> Automatic bids would be awarded to regular season conference champions, with tiebreakers applied as needed. You can learn more on how tie-breakers are broken through <a href="selection-process.html">the selection process</a>.  By eliminating conference championship games, this approach does the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Creates equal rest for all playoff teams</li>
          <li>Eliminates the redundancy of both conference championship participants making the playoff</li>
          <li>Avoids punishing teams for losing championship games</li>
          <li>Simplifies scheduling and selection</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alternative: Keep conference championship games.</b> Some conferences may prefer to maintain championship games for tradition, revenue, or competitive reasons. A few Division II and Division III conferences currently do this. If conferences choose this path, championship games would occur the weekend before Thanksgiving, with additional scheduling considerations. You can learn more in <a href="conference-championship-flexibility.html">the alternative solution to keep conference championship games</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Regular Season Game Options</h2>
      <p>
        By eliminating the conference championship games, we no longer have to break ties to determine which of the two teams would play in given conference championship games in a given multi-way tie.  In addition, administering conference play-in games should become a complete non-starter.  Instead, we are going back to conferences naming co-champions concluding the regular season.  The overall conference champion would be determined through tie-breakers instead.  However, each conference will make a different set of tie-breakers to determine their overall conference champion.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, regardless of the number of teams in the conference, it would be up to each conference on the composition of conference and non-conference games.  
      </p>
      <h3>Keeping the Regular Season at 12 or 13 Games</h3>
      <p>
        If the football season sticks with only a 12-game or 13-game regular season schedule without the conference championship games, the regular season would be like the current FCS schedule since 2026.  It would look like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
            <th>Opening Weekend</th>
            <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
            <th>Army-Navy</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">12</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 25-29</td>
            <td rowspan="4">
              Weekend Before Thanksgiving <br/>
              (Weekend of Nov. 17-23)
            </td>
            <td rowspan="4">Saturday After Thanksgiving 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Weekend of Aug. 18-24</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">13</td>
            <td>1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 16-17</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams playing a 12-game schedule with one bye week would start their season around Aug. 25-29 (if Labor Day falls on Sept. 3-7).  Teams playing a 12-game schedule with two bye weeks or a 13-game schedule with one bye week would start their season around Aug. 18-24.  Teams playing a 13-game schedule with two bye weeks would start their season around Aug. 16-17 (if Labor Day falls on Sept. 1 or 2).   
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on how many games teams want to play in the regular season, all conferences would do the following with a 12-game or 13-game regular season schedule:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Total Regular Season Games</th>
            <th>Possible Schedule Combinations</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>
              4 Non Conference Games + 8 Conference Games <br/>
              3 Non Conference Games + 9 Conference Games <br/>
              2 Non Conference Games + 10 Conference Games <br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>
              4 Non Conference Games + 9 Conference Games <br/>
              3 Non Conference Games + 10 Conference Games <br/>
              2 Non Conference Games + 11 Conference Games <br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Expanding the Regular Season to 14 Games</h3>
      <p>
        With the elimination of conference championship games, the regular season can be increased up to a 14-game schedule.  The 13-game regular season schedule would also be adjusted to make room for a potential 14-game schedule.  By potentially implementing a 14-game schedule, this is how the regular season would look:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Games</th>
            <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
            <th>Opening Weekend</th>
            <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
            <th>Army-Navy</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>12</td>
            <td rowspan="3">1</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 25-31</td>
            <td rowspan="3">
              Weekend Before Thanksgiving <br/>
              (Weekend of Nov. 17-23)
            </td>
            <td rowspan="3">Saturday After Thanksgiving 3PM EST</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 18-24</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>Weekend of Aug. 11-17</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        While the possible combination of the 13-game regular season schedule would still apply, the possible combinations for a 14-game regular season schedule would look like the following:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Total Regular Season Games</th>
            <th>Possible Schedule Combinations</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>
              4 Non Conference Games + 10 Conference Games <br/>
              3 Non Conference Games + 11 Conference Games <br/>
              2 Non Conference Games + 12 Conference Games <br/>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Do all FBS Teams have to play 12, 13, or 14 regular season games?</h3>
      <p>
        No, this is meant to be flexible for all FBS Conferences and Independents.  Any FBS Conference or Independent that prefer to maintain a 12-game schedule may do so, beginning their season the weekend of Aug. 25-31. The flexibility of different schedule lengths is already proven at the FCS level. All FCS teams play a 12-game schedule since the 2026 season except for the Ivy League, where all their teams play only a 10-game schedule. When the Ivy League became playoff eligible since the 2025 season, Harvard (9-1) and Yale (8-2) made the FCS playoff field despite playing only 10 games. The selection committee evaluated their schedules fairly and both teams competed legitimately. The same principle applies to any conference who decides to stick with playing 12 regular season games or to go up to a 14-game regular season schedule to be considered for the 32-team field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams playing a 14-game schedule would still have one scheduled bye week during the regular season.  The Army-Navy week would serve as their second bye week, ensuring equal rest entering the playoffs regardless of schedule length.
      </p>
      <h2>Army-Navy Game</h2>
      <p>
        The Army-Navy game remains a standalone finale, kicking off on the Saturday after Thanksgiving at 3PM ET. This serves as a bye week for all other FBS teams, ensuring everyone enters the playoff with equal rest. If Army and/or Navy make the playoff, they would have had two bye weeks during the regular season and play their first playoff game the following week (no earlier than Friday).
      </p>

      <h2>Selection Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Selection Show:</b> Saturday after Thanksgiving at 7:30PM ET
      </p>
      <p>
        The selection show would announce the 32-team field, seeding for teams 1-16, and first-round matchups. This timing allows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teams to prepare for their first-round opponents</li>
        <li>Media buildup and promotional opportunities</li>
        <li>Playoff kickoff the following Wednesday (first weekend of December)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Academic Calendar Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Ending the regular season before Thanksgiving aligns well with academic calendars. Most teams finish their season before final exams, and playoff games occur during winter break for most institutions. This reduces conflicts between athletics and academics compared to the current system where championship games and early playoff rounds often coincide with finals week.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparison to Current and Other Proposed Systems</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Aspect</th>

          <td>3rd or 4th Monday of January</td>
          <td>Second Friday or Saturday of January</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NFL Conflicts?</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>No</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h2>The Regular Season Will Still Have Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        The regular season will continue to have <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/why-32-teams/regular-season-importance.html">importance</a>.  It would help teams put themselves in better position for a path to a National Championship.  Division I FCS, Division II, and Division III had no problem with their regular season even though they have historically expanded their playoff field in the past.
