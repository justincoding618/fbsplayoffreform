    <h2>Performance-Based Payout Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff uses a performance-based revenue model where teams
      earn money for each round they advance through. This creates powerful
      incentives for competitive success while ensuring broad distribution of
      playoff revenue across the entire FBS ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h3>Payout Per Round</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Playoff Round</th>
        <th>FBS Conferences and Notre Dame</th>
        <th>Other FBS Independents</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>First Round</td>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Cumulative Earnings</h3>
    <p>
      Teams accumulate earnings as they advance through the playoff. A team that
      reaches the National Championship game earns significantly more than one
      that exits in the first round:

    <h2>Total Distribution Per Round</h2>
    <p>
      The total amount distributed each round (without non-Notre Dame FBS
      Independents) demonstrates the massive revenue potential of a 32-team
      playoff:

    <h2>Conference Distribution Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      Revenue flows through conferences, which then distribute to member
      institutions according to their existing media deal agreements:
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Teams earn:</b> Each participating team earns money for their
        conference based on playoff performance
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conferences accumulate:</b> All earnings from a conference's teams
        are pooled
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conferences distribute:</b> Each conference divides its total playoff
        revenue according to its own internal agreements
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Scenario</h3>
    <p>Let's say the SEC has 7 teams make the 32-team playoff:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>7 teams make the playoff field (7 × $7M = $49M)</li>
      <li>5 teams advance to the second round (5 × $9M = $45M)</li>
      <li>3 teams reach the quarterfinals (3 × $12M = $36M)</li>
      <li>1 team reaches the semifinals (1 × $14M = $14M)</li>
      <li>0 teams reach the national championship game (0 × $18M = $0)</li>
      <li><b>Total SEC playoff revenue: $144M</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The SEC would then distribute this $144M among its member schools
      according to its revenue-sharing agreement. Some conferences split
      equally; others use performance-based internal distributions.
    </p>
    <p>Let's say the Big Ten has 7 teams make the 32-team playoff:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>7 teams make the playoff field (7 × $7M = $49M)</li>
      <li>5 teams advance to the second round (5 × $9M = $45M)</li>
      <li>3 teams reach the quarterfinals (3 × $12M = $36M)</li>
      <li>2 teams reach the semifinals (2 × $14M = $28M)</li>
      <li>1 team reaches the national championship game (1 × $18M = $18M)</li>
      <li><b>Total Big Ten playoff revenue: $176M</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Big Ten would then distribute this $176M among its member schools
      according to its revenue-sharing agreement. Some conferences split
      equally; others use performance-based internal distributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> These examples demonstrate how conference revenue varies
      based on both the number of teams selected and their performance. The Big
      Ten earns more than the SEC in this scenario because one of their teams
      reached the championship game, showing how deep playoff runs significantly
      impact conference revenue.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Model Works</h2>

    <h3>Performance-Based Incentives</h3>
    <p>
      Exponentially increasing payouts create powerful incentives for
      competitive success. Advancing from the quarterfinals to the semifinals
      adds $14M, while advancing to the championship adds another $18M. This
      rewards excellence while ensuring all playoff participants receive
      meaningful revenue.
    </p>

    <h3>Conference Competition</h3>
    <p>
      Conferences are incentivized to have as many teams make the playoff as
      possible and to have those teams advance as far as possible. A conference
      with multiple teams making deep runs can earn significantly more than one
      with fewer participants or early exits.
    </p>

    <h3>Access and Equity</h3>
    <p>
      All 10 conference champions receive automatic bids, ensuring every
      conference has access to playoff revenue. Non-power FBS conferences can
      earn substantial money if their champion makes a run, while the 22
      at-large bids ensure power conference depth is rewarded.
    </p>

    <h3>Scalability</h3>
    <p>
      The model scales naturally with media rights growth. As broadcast deals
      increase in value, per-round payouts can increase proportionally,
      benefiting all participants. The structure remains constant even as dollar
      amounts evolve.
    </p>
    <h2>Consolation Bowl Game Payouts</h2>
    <p>
      Since the consolation bowl games are only going to be administerd for second round participants only, FBS Conferences, Notre Dame, and FBS Independents will receive the following payouts of the consolation bowl games: 
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Bowl Game</th>
          <th>FBS Conferences and Notre Dame</th>
          <th>Non-Notre Dame FBS Independents</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Citrus Bowl</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alamo Bowl</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ReliaQuest Bowl</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Holiday Bowl</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      If the <a href="supplements/secondary-playoffs.html">low-tier playoff solution</a> is not implemented, then consolation games for both first and second round participants are mandatory.  If the consolation bowl games are only administered for the eliminated second round participants, then only the Citrus Bowl, Alamo Bowl, ReliaQuest Bowl, and Holiday Bowl would remain and implementing the low-tier playoff solution would be required.  The total revenue for implementing consolation bowl games for first round and second round participants or second round participants only would be the following (excluding non-Notre Dame FBS Independents):
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Consolation Bowl Games</th>
          <th>Total Bowl Games</th>
          <th>Total Distribution</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Second Round Participants Only</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>$44M</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Timing:</b> Consolation bowl games for eliminated playoff participants would be played sometime after Christmas and before around New Year's Day. This maintains the traditional bowl season timeline while integrating playoff participants.
      </p>
    <h2>Comparison to Current System</h2>
    <table>

        <td>Varies by round reached</td>
        <td>$60M for championship participant</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Additional Revenue Streams</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the base playoff distribution, the 32-team format creates
      additional revenue opportunities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Campus site ticket sales:</b> First two rounds generate significant
        gate revenue for host schools
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Concessions and merchandise:</b> 16 campus sites in Round 1 create
        local economic impact
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bowl game revenue:</b> New Year's Six bowls maintain traditional
        payouts and prestige
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sponsorship opportunities:</b> More games create more inventory for
        sponsors
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Media sublicensing:</b> International rights, streaming platforms,
        highlight packages
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Long-Term Financial Sustainability</h2>
    <p>The performance-based model ensures financial sustainability because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue grows with the sport's popularity, not against it</li>
      <li>All conferences have incentive to invest in competitive programs</li>
      <li>
        Non-power FBS schools can fund athletic departments through playoff
        access
      </li>
      <li>
        Power conferences still benefit from depth (more at-large bids, more
        total revenue)
      </li>
      <li>Media partners get more premium content to sell</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This creates a system that benefits everyone in the FBS rather than concentrating
      wealth among a small number of programs.
