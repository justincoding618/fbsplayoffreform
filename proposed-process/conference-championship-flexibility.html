        <b>Key Point:</b> Conferences can choose whether to hold championship
        games or completely eliminate them. For conferences that eliminate them,
        the automatic bid goes to the regular season champion (with tiebreakers
        as needed). If a conference holds a championship game, the conference
        championship winner will clinch an automatic bid to the playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Precedent:</b> Women's volleyball, Division II, and Division III all
        successfully allow this flexibility.

    <h1>Keeping or Eliminating Conference Championship Games</h1>
    <p>
      In 1992, the SEC officially introduced the conference championship game
      after expanding their conference to 12 teams. Since then, all other
      conferences followed suit and all FBS conferences now hold a conference
      championship game to determine their conference champion. However, as most
      of the conferences have eliminated divisions, determining the top two
      teams to play for the championship game became complicated due to the
      tie-breakers enforced in certain conferences. When the Big Ten introduced
      the 24-team format, the Big Ten is in favor of eliminating the conference
      championship game (but introduces a worse solution by proposing conference
      play-in games that would supplement multiple automatic bids). However, the
      SEC still wants to keep their conference championship.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're likely going to ask: is it possible for certain conferences to not
      hold conference championship games while others still do?
      <b>Yes, it is possible.</b> There is precedent that it works in other
      sports and in lower football divisions. Let's look at the possibilities
      that would work.
    </p>
    <h2>The Recommended Approach</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/proposed-process/regular-season.html">optimal solution</a> is for all conferences to eliminate championship games and determine champions through regular season records with tiebreakers.</b>  This provides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent scheduling (all teams play 12-14 regular season games)</li>
      <li>No bye week disparities between conferences</li>
      <li>Clear, fair championship determination</li>
      <li>Simplified playoff selection process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, the proposal includes flexibility for conferences that choose to
      maintain championship games for revenue or tradition.
    </p>

    <h2>How Game Counts Work</h2>

    <h3>Scenario 1: All Conferences Eliminate Championship Games</h3>
    <p>
      All teams play 12-14 regular season games ending the weekend before
      Thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Number of Regular Season Games</th>
        <th>Regular Season Opener</th>
        <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
        <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>Weekend of August 23-29</td>
        <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        <td>
          1 Bye Week: Weekend of August 25-29 Start<br />
          2 Bye Weeks: Weekend of August 23-24 Start
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>
          Weekend of August 18-24<br />
          OR<br />
          Weekend of August 16-22
        </td>
        <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        <td>
          1 Bye Week: Weekend of August 18-24 Start<br />
          OR<br />
          2 Bye Weeks: Weekend August 16-17 Start
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>Weekend of August 11-17</td>
        <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        <td>1 Bye Week</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Scenario 2: Mixed Approach (Some Keep Championship Games)</h3>
    <p>
      If some conferences keep championship games while others don't, teams will
      play different total games:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Number of Regular Season Games</th>
        <th>Regular Season Opener</th>
        <th>Regular Season Finale</th>
        <th>Number of Bye Weeks</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>12 + Conference Championship Game</td>
        <td>
          Weekend of August 18-24<br />
          OR<br />
          Weekend of August 16-22
        </td>
        <td>
          Every team would play their 12th game on Penultimate Weekend before
          Thanksgiving<br />
          Conference Championship Game on Weekend Before Thanksgiving
        </td>
        <td>
          1 Bye Week: Weekend of August 18-24 Start<br />
          OR<br />
          2 Bye Weeks: Weekend August 16-17 Start
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>
          Weekend of August 18-24<br />
          OR<br />
          Weekend of August 16-22
        </td>
        <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        <td>
          1 Bye Week: Weekend of August 18-24 Start<br />
          OR<br />
          2 Bye Weeks: Weekend August 16-17 Start
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>13 + Conference Championship Game</td>
        <td>Weekend of August 11-17</td>
        <td>
          Every team would play their 13th game on Penultimate Weekend before
          Thanksgiving<br />
          Conference Championship Game on Weekend Before Thanksgiving
        </td>
        <td>1 Bye Week</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>Weekend of August 11-17</td>
        <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
        <td>1 Bye Week</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Conferences without championship games:</b> 13 or 14 regular season
        games (all teams)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conferences with championship games:</b> 12 or 13 regular season
        games + 1 championship game = 13 or 14 total (for top 2 teams only);
        other teams play 12 or 13 games
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Big Ten</b> (no championship game): All 18 teams play 13 or 14
        regular season games
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SEC</b> (keeps championship game): 14 teams play 12 or 13 games; 2
        teams (championship game participants) play 13 or 14 total
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>The Problem This Creates:</b> SEC teams that don't make the
      championship game play one fewer game than Big Ten teams. This disparity
      is why eliminating championship games is the cleaner solution.
    </p>
    <h2>Proven Precedent: This Already Works in Other Sports and Divisions</h2>

    <h3>Women's College Volleyball</h3>
    <p>
      Some conferences crown champions after the regular season; others hold
      conference tournaments. Both models coexist successfully. The regular
      season ends around Thanksgiving weekend for all conferences, then the NCAA
      Tournament begins.
    </p>

    <h3>Division II Football</h3>
    <p>
      A few conferences hold championship games while others determine champions
      through regular season records. Teams play either 10-11 regular season
      games or 9-10 games plus a championship. This has worked for years.
    </p>

    <h3>Division III Football - SCIAC Model</h3>
    <p>
      The SCIAC has "championship week" as the 10th regular season game.
      Division winners play for the conference title while other teams play
      cross-division opponents based on standings. Everyone plays 10 games
      total. All other Division III football conferences play 10 games (except
      for the NESCAC, where all their teams play a 9-game conference only
      schedule).
    </p>

        >If lower divisions can successfully implement flexible championship
        models, FBS can too.</b
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Flexibility Is Important</h2>

    <p>
      The current 12-team playoff has exposed a critical flaw: when both
      conference championship game participants are already playoff-bound, the
      game becomes redundant. In 2024 and 2025, both the SEC and Big Ten
      Champions and runner-ups were making the playoff regardless of the
      outcome, diminishing the game's stakes.
    </p>

    <p>By making championship games optional:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conferences maintain autonomy over determining their conference champion
      </li>
      <li>
        The SEC can keep their lucrative championship games if they choose
      </li>
      <li>Other conferences can eliminate the expense and complication</li>
      <li>
        The playoff selection process becomes clearer and more transparent
      </li>
      <li>No conference is forced into a one-size-fits-all model</li>
      <li>
        Teams competing for at-large bids aren't disadvantaged by playing one
        fewer game
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>This flexibility is a strength of the proposal, not a compromise.</b>
      It respects conference traditions while solving the structural problem of
      meaningless championship games in the playoff era.
    </p>
    <h2>Why the Mixed Approach Creates Problems (And Why Uniform Elimination Is Better)</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The stand-alone Army-Navy game gives the rest of the FBS teams at least one extra bye week at the end of the regular season.</b>  For teams that do make the 32-team field, the difference between the amount of rest weeks is significant between teams that do play on the weekend before Thanksgiving and teams that do not. The gap between the last game and the first round game would look like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Regular Season Game</th>
          <th>Number of Weeks until First Round</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Penultimate Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
          <td> 3 Weeks </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
          <td> 2 Weeks </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the 24-team proposal that is floated by the Big Ten, the gap between last game to the next game is way worse.  The gap between the last game and team's next game after earning a first round bye would look like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Regular Season Game</th>
          <th>Number of Weeks until Second Round</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Penultimate Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
          <td> 4 Weeks </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Weekend Before Thanksgiving</td>
          <td> 3 Weeks </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      In lower NCAA Divisions, there is no problem with unequal layoffs, bye-induced rust, and massive competitive imbalance. In Divsion I FCS and Division III, teams that make the playoffs and earn a bye would have their next game in two weeks.  Otherwise, teams would play the next week concluding the regular season. Division II teams that do make the playoffs play the next week concluding the regular season. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some will think the 24-team field is better because it closes the gap for bye teams.  However, because the Army-Navy game stand alone game still gives all FBS teams at least one bye week at the end of the regular season, we would still be dealing with unequal layoffs, bye-induced rust, multiple autobids undermining conference championships (with conference play-in games making the solution worse), and massive competitive imbalance.
      <h3>Timeline Comparison: Why Uniform Elimination Works Best</h3>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Conference Structure</th>
          <th>Last Game</th>
          <th>Weeks Off Before Playoff</th>
          <th>Competitive Impact</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>All conferences eliminate championship games</td>
          <td>Weekend before Thanksgiving</td>
          <td>2 weeks (uniform for all 32 teams)</td>
          <td>✓ Fair and equal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mixed: Some keep championship games</td>
          <td>Varies (penultimate weekend vs. weekend before Thanksgiving)</td>
          <td>2-3 weeks (unequal)</td>
          <td>✗ Creates bye-induced rust disparity</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>24-team with byes (Big Ten proposal)</td>
          <td>Varies (penultimate weekend vs. weekend before Thanksgiving)</td>
          <td>3-4 weeks for bye teams (severe inequality)</td>
          <td>✗✗ Massive competitive imbalance</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the 32-team field and eliminating conference championship games, every team would end the regular season on the same weekend.  Teams that end the regular season on the same weekend and make the 32-team field would all have no more than a two-week layoff and eliminate the induced-rust.  
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      While the 32-team playoff provides flexibility for conferences to maintain championship games if they choose, the optimal implementation eliminates them entirely. This ensures all teams end their regular season simultaneously, provides equal rest periods before playoff games, eliminates competitive imbalances from unequal layoffs, and removes the complication of championship games where both participants are already playoff-bound. The precedent from lower divisions and other sports proves this flexibility can work, but the Army-Navy standalone game creates unique layoff disparities that make uniform elimination the superior choice. Conferences gain conference autonomy while the playoff structure remains fair and balanced for all participants.
