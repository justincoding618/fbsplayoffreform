      <h1>Proposed New and Existing Resources</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The 32-team playoff requires a sophisticated, transparent selection
        process that balances subjective evaluation with objective metrics. This
        page outlines the combination of existing computer rankings, new
        analytical tools, and clear scheduling requirements that would guide the
        selection committee in ranking all 32 playoff teams fairly and
        consistently.
      </p>

      <p>The system uses three categories of resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Existing Resources:</b> Proven computer ranking systems (SP+,
          former BCS computer rankings)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>New Analytical Tools:</b> Tier System, Playoff Evaluation Tool
          (PET)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scheduling Requirements:</b> Clear win thresholds based on strength
          of schedule composition
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Following the conclusion of the regular season, the selection committee
        would utilize a combination of these resources to evaluate teams for
        playoff spots and seeding positions.
      </p>

      <h2>Existing Resources</h2>

      <h3>Bill Connelly's SP+ Football Ratings</h3>
      <p>
        Bill Connelly introduced his SP+ ranking system in 2008. SP+ is a
        measure of the most sustainable and predictable phases of football:
        success rate (efficiency), explosiveness, finishing drives, and field
        position. Luck and random variance are filtered out as much as possible.
        The overall rating of each team equals their offensive rating minus
        their defensive rating plus their special teams rating. This assessment
        is similar to the KenPom Ratings for men's college basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
        SP+ is particularly valuable because it focuses on predictive power
        rather than simply rewarding wins. A team that wins 10-9 by getting
        lucky turnovers rates lower than a team that wins 31-28 by dominating
        yardage and explosiveness. This helps identify which teams are genuinely
        elite versus which teams have over-performed their underlying metrics.
      </p>

      <h3>Former BCS Computer Rankings</h3>
      <p>
        Six computer ranking systems that were part of the now-defunct BCS
        provide additional objective evaluation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Anderson & Hester Rankings:</b> Created by Jeff Anderson and Chris
          Hester, this system uses mathematical formulas based on teams'
          performances and results
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Billingsley Report:</b> Richard Billingsley's system emphasizes
          win-loss records and opponent strength based on the opponent's record,
          rating, and rank, with strong emphasis on recent performance
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Colley Matrix:</b> Dr. Wes Colley's system evaluates teams based on
          FBS wins (including games against FCS competition) and adjusts for
          strength of schedule using a mathematical matrix
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Massey Ratings:</b> Kenneth Massey created this system to measure
          past performances of FBS teams using least-squares fitting and
          opponent adjustments
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sagarin Ratings:</b> Jeff Sagarin's ratings are based on the Elo
          Chess System adapted for football, where wins and losses against
          quality opponents are the primary factors
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wolfe Ratings:</b> Peter Wolfe invented this system to rank and
          rate FBS teams using maximum likelihood estimation, a statistical
          method that determines the most probable relative strengths of teams
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The average of these six computer rankings, combined with SP+, provides
        a comprehensive objective evaluation that no single system could provide
        alone. By averaging multiple methodologies, the selection committee
        gains a more complete picture of team quality.
      </p>

      <h3>Overall Record and Scheduling Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Standards for Power Conference teams and non-Power FBS conference teams
        differ due to the nature of their typical schedules. Since it is
        strongly recommended to
        <a
          href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/proposed-process/regular-season.html"
          >eliminate conference championship games</a
        >, any conference/team can schedule up to 14 games, resulting in a
        regular season range of 12-14 games.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Key Principles:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each FBS team can play no more than one non-FBS team without penalty
        </li>
        <li>
          For every additional non-FBS team added to the schedule beyond the
          first, one more win is needed to gain playoff consideration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Schedules must contain at least 90% FBS opponents to gain full
          consideration. For any regular season schedule length of 12-14 games,
          that means the following:
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Number of Regular Season Games</th>
                <th>Minimum Number of FBS Opponents</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>12</td>
                <td>11</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>13</td>
                <td>12</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>14</td>
                <td>13</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each FBS team is categorized into one of three groups based on their
        overall body of work of their overall record and schedule composition:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Premier Contender:</b> These teams have nearly a 100% chance of
          becoming an at-large selection (if those teams do not win their
          conference) due to their overall great body of work. They would need a
          significant momentum swing to miss the cut.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wildcard Contender:</b> Teams have a good enough chance of becoming
          an at-large selection (if those teams do not win their conference).
          However, despite their overall good body of work, these teams need at
          least some help to truly be on the right side of the fringe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fringe Contender:</b> These teams are truly "on the fringe" for an
          at-large bid (if those teams do not win their conference) as every win
          and loss can shift their overall standing from potentially being on
          the right or wrong side of the fringe. Those teams need significant
          help to gain one of the final playoff spots.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Premier Contenders</h3>
      <p>
        Premier contenders are teams that have great body of work and would
        almost be guaranteed to become an at-large selection (given that they
        are not named the overall conference champion). A great body of work for
        premier contenders depends on the team's overall resume as well their
        record based on their given schedule. Here is what a premier contender
        would look like for those teams:
      </p>
      <p><b>Premier Contender's Projected Overall Body of Work</b></p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Games Played</th>
            <th>Number of FBS Opponents in Schedule</th>
            <th>Power Conference Teams Overall Record</th>
            <th>Non-Power FBS Conference Teams Overall Record</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>11-12</td>
            <td>10-2 or better</td>
            <td>11-1 or better</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>12-13</td>
            <td>11-2 or better</td>
            <td>12-1 or better</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>13-14</td>

            <td>12-2 or better</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3>Wildcard Contenders</h3>
      <p>
        Wildcard contenders are teams that have a good enough body of work to
        become considered for an at-large selection (given that they are not
        named the overall conference champion). However, those teams are not
        completely immune as they could also fall on the wrong side of the
        fringe. Here is what a wildcard contender would look like for those
        teams:
      </p>
      <p><b>Wildcard Contender's Projected Overall Body of Work</b></p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Games Played</th>
            <th>Number of FBS Opponents in Schedule</th>
            <th>Power Conference Teams Overall Record</th>
            <th>Non-Power FBS Conference Teams Overall Record</th>
          </tr>

            <td>10-4</td>
            <td>11-3</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3>Fringe Contenders</h3>
      <p>
        Fringe contenders are teams that are truly "on the fringe" for an
        at-large bid (if those teams do not win their conference). Every win and
        loss can shift their overall standing from potentially being on the
        right or wrong side of the fringe. Those teams need significant help to
        gain one of the final playoff spots. What does a fringe team potentially
        look like? Here is what it would look like for those teams:

            <td>14</td>
            <td>13-14</td>
            <td>9-5 or 8-6</td>
            <td>10-4 or 9-5</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3>Playing more than one non-FBS Opponent</h3>
      <p>
        Teams that would play more than one non-FBS opponent will likely become
        wildcard contenders at best. Any additional non-FBS opponents on a
        teams' schedule beyond the first would require a team to win one more
        game to gain playoff consideration. Becoming a premier contender while
        playing more than one non-FBS team would require a team to be nearly
        flawless for power conference teams or be flawless/nearly flawless for
        non-power FBS conference teams.

        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        <b>Key Insight:</b> The more non-FBS opponents played, the less room for
        error. A team's schedule with 2-3 non-FBS teams looks far less favorable
        than a schedule containing only 0-1 non-FBS teams. FBS teams must
        balance FCS opponents against the schedule strength penalty they incur.
      </p>

      <h3>Tier System</h3>
      <p>
        The tier system adapts college basketball's quadrant system to college
        football. It determines the overall resume for all Division I FBS teams
        by categorizing opponents into four tiers based on their ranking.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Background:</b> The NCAA introduced the quadrant system for Division
        I Men's Basketball in February 2018 after Monmouth became one of the
        first four teams to miss the NCAA tournament in 2016 despite winning
        many games away from their home court. The quadrant system was designed
        to place greater emphasis on winning away from home and to recognize the
        difficulty of earning those wins.
      </p>

      <p>
        For college football, the tier system focuses on opponent ranking rather
        than game location because FBS schedules have uneven home-road splits.
        Some teams play 7 home games and 5 road games, while others play 6-6
        splits. Since schedule balance varies so widely, tiers are based solely
        on opponent quality.
      </p>

      <p><b>Tier Definitions:</b></p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Tier</th>
          <th>Opponent Ranking</th>
          <th>Quality Level</th>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        <b>How Tiers Work:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Tier 1 wins are the holy grail:</b> Defeating top-35 opponents
          significantly strengthens a team's playoff case. These are
          resume-defining victories
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tier 2 wins demonstrate quality:</b> While not as impressive as
          Tier 1 wins, defeating teams ranked 36-70 shows a team can compete
          against solid competition
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tier 3 losses aren't terrible:</b> Losing to average teams (71-105)
          isn't ideal but doesn't severely damage playoff hopes if balanced with
          quality wins
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tier 4 losses are devastating:</b> Losing to teams ranked 106+ or
          to non-FBS opponents can eliminate playoff chances, especially if the
          team lacks Tier 1 and Tier 2 wins
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Dynamic Tier Adjustments:</b> Opponent tiers change every week as
        teams' rankings fluctuate. A win over a team initially ranked #25 (Tier
        1) might become a Tier 2 win if that opponent falls to #45 later in the
        season. Conversely, a loss to a team initially ranked #110 (Tier 4)
        might improve to a Tier 3 loss if that opponent surges to #85.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams won't know their true tier wins and losses until the conclusion of
        the regular season. This prevents teams from claiming victories over
        "top 25 teams" when those opponents finish with losing records. What
        matters is opponent quality at season's end (especially when it comes
        time to evaluate how teams do vs playoff-bound competition), not at the
        time the game was played.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Exception for Neutral Site Rivalry Games:</b> For teams that always
        play one of their rivalry games on a neutral site (such as the Red River
        Showdown between Oklahoma and Texas, or the Florida-Georgia rivalry in
        Jacksonville), these games count as road or home wins depending on who
        the designated home and visiting teams are for that particular season.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Tier Evaluation Sources:</b> Tiers are determined based on the
        average rankings from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bill Connelly's SP+ Football Ratings</li>
        <li>Anderson & Hester</li>
        <li>Billingsley</li>
        <li>Colley Matrix</li>
        <li>Massey Ratings</li>
        <li>Sagarin Ratings</li>
        <li>Wolfe Ratings</li>
        <li>Playoff Evaluation Tool (PET) rankings</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Playoff Evaluation Tool (PET)</h3>
      <p>
        The Playoff Evaluation Tool (PET) is one of the main resources for
        selecting and seeding the FBS playoff field. PET works similarly to the
        NET rankings in college basketball, taking into account Strength of
        Schedule (SOS), Net Efficiency, and Winning Percentage.
      </p>

      <h4>Strength of Schedule (SOS)</h4>
      <p>
        Strength of Schedule determines how each team's opponents perform based
        on their wins and losses. SOS is critically important because not all
        regular season schedules are created equal. The SOS formula considers
        only games against FBS opponents.
      </p>

      <p><b>FBS Strength of Schedule Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        FBS Strength of Schedule = (FBS Total Wins) / (Total Games Played)²
      </p>

      <p><b>FBS Total Wins Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        FBS Total Wins = Total Winning FBS Opponent Percentage × (Games Played
        vs FBS Teams)²
      </p>

      <p><b>Total Winning FBS Opponent Percentage Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Total Winning FBS Opp. Percentage = (Total FBS Opponent Wins) / (Total
        FBS Opponent Wins + Total FBS Opponent Losses)
      </p>

      <p><b>Why This Formula Works:</b></p>
      <p>
        The formula adjusts for schedules that don't contain all FBS opponents.
        If a team plays one or more non-FBS opponents, the (Games Played vs FBS
        Teams)² factor normalizes the total wins of FBS opponents. This prevents
        teams from inflating their SOS by playing weak FCS opponents.
      </p>

      <p><b>Example 1: Team with 1 FCS Opponent</b></p>
      <p>
        A team plays 11 FBS opponents (each playing 12-game schedules) and 1 FCS
        opponent. The 11 FBS opponents have a combined 58 wins.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Total FBS Opponent Wins + Losses = 11 × 12 = 132<br />
        Total Winning FBS Opponent Percentage = 58 / 132 ≈ 0.439<br />
        FBS Total Wins = 0.439 × (11)² = 0.439 × 121 ≈ 53.2<br />
        FBS Strength of Schedule = 53.2 / (12)² = 53.2 / 144 ≈ 0.369
      </p>

      <p><b>Example 2: Team with 2 FCS Opponents</b></p>
      <p>
        A team plays 10 FBS opponents (each playing 12-game schedules) and 2 FCS
        opponents. The 10 FBS opponents have a combined 50 wins.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Total FBS Opponent Wins + Losses = 10 × 12 = 120<br />
        Total Winning FBS Opponent Percentage = 50 / 120 ≈ 0.417<br />
        FBS Total Wins = 0.417 × (10)² = 0.417 × 100 ≈ 41.7<br />
        FBS Strength of Schedule = 41.7 / (12)² = 41.7 / 144 ≈ 0.289
      </p>

      <p><b>Example 3: Team with All-FBS Schedule</b></p>
      <p>
        A team plays 12 FBS opponents (each playing 12-game schedules). The 12
        FBS opponents have a combined 78 wins.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Total FBS Opponent Wins + Losses = 12 × 12 = 144<br />
        Total Winning FBS Opponent Percentage = 78 / 144 ≈ 0.542<br />
        FBS Total Wins = 0.542 × (12)² = 0.542 × 144 ≈ 78<br />
        FBS Strength of Schedule = 78 / (12)² = 78 / 144 ≈ 0.542
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Key Insight:</b> Playing FCS opponents significantly lowers SOS.
        Example 2 (SOS = 0.289) has a much weaker schedule than Example 3 (SOS =
        0.542) despite both teams playing 12 games. The all-FBS schedule is
        rewarded appropriately.
      </p>

      <h4>Net Efficiency</h4>
      <p>
        Net Efficiency measures how effectively a team performs on offense,
        defense, and special teams. It uses efficiency (points per possession)
        rather than total points to account for different game paces and
        possession counts.
      </p>

      <p><b>Overall Net Efficiency Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Net Efficiency = Net Offensive Efficiency + Net Special Teams Efficiency
        - Net Defensive Efficiency
      </p>

      <p><b>Net Offensive Efficiency Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Net Offensive Efficiency = (Total Team Points) / (Total Team
        Possessions)
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Where Total Team Possessions = Touchdown-Ending Possessions +
        Turnover-Ending Possessions + Special Team-Ending Possessions
      </p>

      <p><b>Net Defensive Efficiency Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Net Defensive Efficiency = (Total Opponent Points) / (Total Opponent
        Possessions)
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Where Total Opponent Possessions = Touchdown-Ending Opp. Possessions +
        Turnover-Ending Opp. Possessions + Special Team-Ending Opp. Possessions
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Special team-ending possessions include drives that end in
        punts or field goal attempts.
      </p>

      <p><b>Net Special Teams Efficiency Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Net Special Teams Efficiency = Net Offensive Special Teams Efficiency -
        Net Defensive Special Teams Efficiency
      </p>

      <p><b>Net Offensive Special Teams Efficiency Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Net Offensive Special Teams Efficiency = (Total Special/Defensive Team
        Points) / (Total Special Team Possessions)
      </p>

      <p><b>Net Defensive Special Teams Efficiency Formula:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Net Defensive Special Teams Efficiency = (Total Opp. Special/Defensive
        Team Points) / (Total Opp. Special Team Possessions)
      </p>

      <p><b>Total Special Teams Possessions Include:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Made extra point or field goal possessions</li>
        <li>Kickoff or punt return possessions</li>
        <li>Special teams touchdown possessions</li>
        <li>Defensive touchdown possessions</li>
        <li>Blocked/missed field goal or extra point possessions</li>
        <li>Muffed kickoff or punt possessions</li>
        <li>Kickoff or punt possessions</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Winning Percentage</h4>
      <p>The simplest metric, but still essential:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Winning Percentage = (Number of Wins) / (Total Games Played)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> PET does not utilize scoring margins, margin of victory,
        average scoring margin, total scoring margins, or Team Value Index. The
        system focuses on efficiency (how well teams perform per possession)
        rather than raw point differentials.
      </p>

      <h3>Fringe Watch</h3>
      <p>
        As the regular season progresses, certain teams become wildcard and
        fringe contenders. "Fringe Watch" is a projection of FBS teams
        contending for the last Division I FBS playoff bids. It has a similar
        meaning to "on the bubble" in college basketball.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>To qualify as a fringe contender, FBS teams must:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Meet the minimum win requirement for at least fringe contention based
          on their schedule composition
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a realistic mathematical path to reaching the required win total
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Teams fall off the fringe when they:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fail to meet their respective minimum win requirements</li>
        <li>Lose to multiple Tier 4 opponents</li>
        <li>Lack any Tier 1 or Tier 2 wins</li>
        <li>
          Have too low a strength of schedule combined with too many losses
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Selection Criteria for Fringe/Wildcard Contenders:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When deciding the final playoff spots among fringe and wildcard
        contenders, the committee considers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Overall Record:</b> Did the team meet or exceed their category
          threshold?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Strength of Schedule:</b> How difficult was their schedule compared
          to other contenders?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tier 1 and Tier 2 Wins:</b> How many quality wins does the team
          have?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tier 3 and Tier 4 Losses:</b> Did the team lose to weak opponents?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>How the CFP Can Implement Fringe Watch:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The College Football Playoff rankings can utilize this feature in two
        ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The bottom five teams of the CFP Top 25 are considered "on fringe
          watch"
        </li>
        <li>
          The CFP can also release a list of the top ten teams outside the Top
          25 (in alphabetical order) that are in contention for an at-large
          playoff bid
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This dual approach provides transparency: teams ranked #21-25 know
        they're on shaky ground, while teams ranked #26-35 know they're still in
        the conversation if they finish strong.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Impact on Seeding:</b> When a fringe or wildcard contender makes the
        playoffs, they typically receive lower seeding and face tougher
        matchups. A team that barely squeaks into the playoff as the #32 seed
        will face the #1 seed on the road in the first round—a difficult path to
        the championship, but still an opportunity to prove themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>How the Committee Uses These Resources</h2>
      <p>
        The selection committee would create the College Football Playoff (CFP)
        rankings using a combination of all mentioned resources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Review each team's overall record and schedule composition to
          determine Premier/Wildcard/Fringe status
        </li>
        <li>Evaluate Tier 1 and Tier 2 wins to identify quality victories</li>
        <li>Examine Tier 3 and Tier 4 losses to identify concerning defeats</li>
        <li>
          Consider computer ranking averages (SP+, BCS computers, PET) for
          objective evaluation
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply subjective judgment for close calls and special circumstances
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The committee would rank teams from 1-32 for the playoff field, with
        additional rankings through #40-50 to identify teams in consideration
        for at-large bids. Alongside the Top 25, the committee would list ten
        teams outside the Top 25 (in alphabetical order) that are in contention
        for a playoff spot.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of This System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Transparency:</b> Clear scheduling requirements and tier
          definitions make selection criteria understandable
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Objectivity:</b> Computer rankings and mathematical formulas reduce
          bias
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Flexibility:</b> Committee can still apply judgment for unique
          situations
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fairness:</b> Different standards for Power/Non-Power teams
          acknowledge schedule reality without being arbitrary
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Incentives:</b> Teams are rewarded for scheduling tough opponents
          and punished for loading up on weak competition
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This comprehensive evaluation system ensures that the 32-team playoff
        field is selected based on a combination of objective data and informed
        judgment, creating a fair and defensible selection process.
