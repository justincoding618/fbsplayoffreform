    <h1>Playoff Sites</h1>
    <h2>Why Site Selection Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Determining where playoff games occur balances two competing priorities: rewarding regular season excellence with home-field advantage, and preserving the traditional bowl system that has defined college football for over a century. Campus sites for early rounds create electric atmospheres and directly reward teams for their regular season performance, while neutral-site bowl games for later rounds maintain tradition and provide spectacular settings for championship-level matchups.

    </p>
    <h2>First Two Rounds</h2>
    <p>
      The first two rounds would occur at the campus sites of the higher seeded teams.  Depending on the seed, here is how home-field would be determined:
      <div id="homefield"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      A team becoming a top 8 seed would host two playoff games.  A team seeded 9-16 would at least host a first round game.  They would be able to host a second-round game if at least one of the top 8 seeds is eliminated in the first round.  If an unseeded team defeats their seeded opponent and faces an unseeded team in the second round, home field would go to the team with the highest CFP ranking.
    </p>
    <h2>Final Three Rounds</h2>
    <p>
      After the first two rounds, the final three rounds would happen at neutral sites.  The New Year’s Six Bowl Games would continue to host the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, with the National Championship game happening at a pre-determined neutral site.  For the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, there are several ways that can happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, the New Year's Rotation would go something like this:
      <div id="ny6table"></div>
    </p>
    </p>
      In Version A of the 3-Year Cycle, the rotation would have the semifinal rotation be similar to the BCS bowl rotation.  The Rose Bowl would become an annual semifinal game, while the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl would rotate in a 3-year cycle to host the other semifinal game.  The Cotton Bowl and Peach Bowl would become permanent quarterfinal games.
    </p>
    </p>
      In Version B of the 3-Year Cycle, the rotation would have the semifinal rotation be similar to the 1937 major bowl rotation.  While the Rose Bowl would still become an annual semifinal game, the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Cotton Bowl would rotate in a 3-year cycle to host the other semifinal game.  The Peach Bowl and Fiesta Bowl would become permanent quarterfinal games.
    </p>
    </p>
      In the 4-Year Cycle, the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl and Fiesta Bowl would rotate to host the other semifinal game.  Those four bowl games would also be guaranteed to host the quarterfinals on years when they do not host the semifinals.  The Peach Bowl would become a permanent quarterfinal game.   
    </p>
    </p>
      Finally, the 5-year cycle would have Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Peach Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl rotating to host the other semifinal game.  All of those bowl games would also be guaranteed to host the quarterfinals on years when they do not host the semifinals.
