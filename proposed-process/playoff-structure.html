      <h1>Playoff Structure</h1>
      <p>
        The 32-team playoff consists of five rounds spanning early December
        through mid-January. The structure balances competitive fairness,
        traditional bowl games, and media distribution while ensuring no team
        gains an unfair advantage through scheduling.

      <h2>Seeding and Selection</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Field Composition:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 Automatic Bids: All FBS conference champions</li>
        <li>
          22 At-Large Bids: Selected by committee based on final regular season
          rankings
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Seeding System:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Top 16 teams are seeded 1-16 based on committee rankings</li>
        <li>
          Teams ranked 17-32 are unseeded (includes lower-ranked conference
          champions)
        </li>
        <li>
          Seeding determines home-field advantage and bowl selection rights
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>First Round Matchups:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>#1 seed plays the lowest-ranked unseeded team</li>
        <li>#2 seed plays the second-lowest-ranked unseeded team</li>
        <li>
          Pattern continues through #16 seed vs. 17th-ranked unseeded team
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hosting and Home-Field Advantage</h2>

      <h3>First Two Rounds (Campus Sites)</h3>
      <p>
        Home-field advantage for the first two rounds is determined by seeding:
      </p>
      <div id="homefield"></div>

      <p>
        <b>Why campus sites matter:</b> Home-field advantage is significant in
        college football. In the first round of the current 12-team playoff,
        home teams went 6-2, demonstrating how crowd support, familiar
        surroundings, and elimination of travel create measurable competitive
        edges. Seeding rewards regular season excellence with tangible playoff
        advantages.
      </p>

      <h3>Quarterfinals and Semifinals (Bowl Sites)</h3>
      <p>
        The quarterfinals and semifinals take place at New Year's Six Bowl
        Games, preserving the tradition and prestige of these historic venues:
      </p>
      <div id="ny6table"></div>

      <p>
        <b>Bowl Selection Process:</b> The highest-seeded team in each
        quarterfinal matchup gets to select which New Year's Six bowl game they
        want to play in. This provides an additional reward for regular season
        success and creates strategic considerations for teams and conferences.
      </p>

      <h3>National Championship (Neutral Site)</h3>
      <p>
        The National Championship game occurs at a pre-determined neutral site,
        rotating among major cities and stadiums as done by the current CFP.
        This maintains the tradition of a neutral championship venue while
        allowing cities to bid and prepare years in advance.
      </p>

      <h2>Bracket Mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        The playoff bracket would be split into <b>eight 4-team regionals</b>.
        Each regional would have two national seeds and two unseeded teams. The
        winners of each first round regional game would play in the Regional
        Finals. The higher seeded team would get to host the regional finals.
        <b
          >The eight regional winners would then advance to the final 8-team
          playoff field that would determine the National Champion.</b
        >
      </p>
      <h3>Reseeding Options</h3>
      <p>
        After the second round, the playoff can either maintain the original
        bracket or reseed teams for the quarterfinals. Both approaches have
        merits:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>No Reseeding (Bracket Integrity):</b> Teams advance through
        predetermined bracket paths, similar to March Madness. This creates
        compelling storylines and allows teams to "see their path" to the
        championship.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Reseeding (Reward Performance):</b> After the second round, remaining
        teams are reseeded 1-8 based on their original seeds. This is similar to
        the Division II football playoffs where the four remaining teams were
        reseeded after the quarterfinals. This ensures the highest-seeded teams
        have the most favorable matchups and maintains incentive for regular
        season performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For detailed examples of how reseeding affects matchups and bowl
        selection, see
        <a href="why-32-teams/competitive-balance.html">Competitive Balance</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Rest and Scheduling Equity</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike formats with first-round byes, the 32-team playoff ensures all
        teams play the same number of games with equal rest periods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All teams enter the playoff with one week of rest (Army-Navy bye
          week). Army and Navy would have two bye weeks during the regular
          season in order to play their stand-alone game on Saturday after
          Thanksgiving. If Army and/or Navy makes the playoff after their
          stand-alone game, their first playoff game would be no earlier than
          Friday. You can learn more on
          <a href="proposed-process/regular-season.html"
            >how the regular season would work.</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams that play Wednesday in Round 1 get their Round 2 game on
          Wednesday
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams that play Friday in Round 1 get their Round 2 game on Friday
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams that play Saturday in Round 1 get their Round 2 game on Friday
          or Saturday (minimum 6 days rest)
        </li>
        <li>
          No team receives a competitive advantage from extended layoffs or
          compressed schedules
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This equal rest principle addresses a major flaw in the current 12-team
        format, where bye teams have gone 1-7 in quarterfinals, suggesting
        extended layoffs harm competitive performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Five Rounds Work</h2>
      <p>Five playoff rounds create the perfect balance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>First Two Rounds:</b> Campus sites reward regular season success
          and create electric atmospheres
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Quarterfinals and Semifinals:</b> Bowl games preserve tradition
          while raising the stakes
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CFP National Championship:</b> Neutral site championship maintains
          prestige and fairness
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The progression from campus sites to bowl games to a neutral
        championship creates a natural escalation in atmosphere and importance,
        mirroring the NFL playoff structure that successfully balances
        home-field advantage with neutral championship venues.
