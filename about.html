    <h1>About the Proposal</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! I thank you for taking the time to read this section! This
      project began as a casual project and evolved into a passionate project.
      Despite the recent setbacks that happened regarding the changing college
      athletic landscape, I created this project to help those visualize how a
      32-team playoff can function for college football in the long-term instead
      of settling on a lower number or incrementally expanding the playoff on a
      needed basis. In addition, I also introduce a secondary playoff system
      that would supplement the bowl games and the main 32-team FBS playoff
      field. The purpose of the secondary playoff system is to provide teams
      missing the Division I FBS Playoffs postseason opportunities. The idea is
      out there for those interested in doing so.
    </p>
    <h3>The Starting Point</h3>
    <p>
      It all began on November 18, 2006. It was the Saturday before Thanksgiving
      and it was the biggest game I have witnessed. #2 Michigan vs #1 Ohio State
      was a battle between the two biggest rivals with the right to go to the
      National Championship Game. The game got very intense throughout as the
      Wolverines always had an answer every time the Buckeyes extended the lead.
      In the end, Ohio State won “The Game,” the Big Ten Championship, and
      clinched the right to play for the National Championship.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because the game was very close, I always wondered if Michigan
      would have been able to gain a rematch. After the game, USC defeated Notre
      Dame, and climbed up to #2 in the BCS standings, while Michigan dropped to
      #3, and Florida was #4. In the final week of the regular season, USC lost
      to UCLA, while Florida won the SEC Championship Game against Arkansas.
      When the final BCS standings were released, Florida was able to just edge
      out Michigan for the #2 spot. Without factoring in the human polls, the
      computers had Florida and Michigan tied at #2. However, the human polls
      were able to propel Florida into the National Championship game. You all
      know how the rest played out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since the 2006 BCS controversy, I always thought of the unanswered
      questions. What if Michigan was able to earn the rematch against Ohio
      State? Would there have been a better way to clear a dispute between
      Florida and Michigan? As I continued to watch college football before the
      College Football Playoff era, it always bothered me that the FBS did not
      hold a playoff. I always pondered, why? Why was the FBS not open to a
      playoff at the time? I continued observing college football, observing the
      BCS controversies that came along with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the College Football Playoff was officially approved, I was excited,
      but was skeptical at the same time. I asked myself: is four teams enough
      to determine a National Champion? When the 2014 season concluded, I was
      happy for Ohio State, but at the same time, I was not impressed with the
      CFP system (even with the eventual expansion to 12 teams ten years later).
      I always felt that the idea was there, but it needed additional
      advancements. After the 2015 season ended and sometime after my graduation
      from Mizzou, on September 10, 2016, I’ve decided to put the postseason
      project in my own hands.
    </p>
    <h3>Unwavering Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      When I first began to brainstorm the project, I’ve first thought of the following:  
      <ul>
        <li>Why would a playoff in College Football made sense? </li>
        <li>How would a playoff be good for college football in the long-term?</li>
        <li>How would it impact the offseason and off-the-field?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      My ideas did not come to life until I analyzed other writers’ articles and fan forums to visualize what they devised.  I saw many wanted to see 6-8 teams and some want 12-16 teams to play for the National Championship.  However, I favored neither of them because it was too conservative and was not modern enough.  I then looked at more writers’ articles of their potential projects until I saw a few that caught my attention.  The two projects that stood out to me were Kelly Martinez’s and <a href="https://wallyhorse.wordpress.com/?s=32-team+playoff"
        >Walt Gekko’s</a> 32-team playoff proposals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the two 32-team playoff projects, Walt Gekko’s stood out to me the most.  Kelly Martinez was one of the earliest to propose a 32-team field, but it didn’t gain much traction.  Walt Gekko was a different story.  He never gave up.  He started advocating for a 32-team playoff on December 7, 2009, the same year the FBS produced five undefeated regular season teams.  Since then, he has always updated his playoff field so he can keep up with the mock postseasons to keep track.  He has done this for many years.  Although there were more writers recently pushing for a 32-team field, Walt Gekko’s was the one that still stood out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then looked into the FCS, Division II, and Division III playoffs.  Division II started administering a 5-round playoff in 2004 (and has expanded it to a 32-team field since 2025), while Division I FCS has organized it since 2010 (and has expanded it to a 24-team field since 2013).  Division III, on the other hand, has structured a 5-round playoff from 1999-2023.  They recently expanded their field to a 6th round beginning in 2024, which is the first time any NCAA level had a 6-round playoff.  I also analyzed the NAIA football seasons and their playoffs.  Analyzing their seasons further, I wanted to understand how each of them were able to play out their regular seasons and then the playoffs.  After comparing them to Walt Gekko’s idea, it all started connecting with me.  I’ve always wondered why Division I FBS has been way behind for so long.  How can I convince at least the majority that my FBS project can be doable for Division I FBS?
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continued through the project, I continued to watch every college
      football season, seeing how each season would play out. Then, there was
      the early signing and national signing periods, spring practices, and the
      recent introduction to NIL and the never-ending conference realignment. I
      then start to realize, this project must be able to provide a positive
      impact on not only on-the-field, but off-the-field too. So, it got me
      wondering, what patterns should I look out for universities’ academic
      calendars? How would they help the balance during the season and
      offseason? What should I look out for in the NFL? And so, I investigated
      academic calendars from my alma mater and from other universities as well.
      I also looked into the recruiting calendars as well as the NFL's
      operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve continued to improve my project (even as I studied through Graduate School at Carnegie Mellon University).  I’ve added in details that could be critical and considered them as well.   To me, I always thought of the 32-team playoff as a vast innovation.   Even though there will be those who disagree, advocating for a 32-team field always felt right to me.  It’s because of the past history in lower NCAA Divisions as well as the potential and capability to do it.  Money is going to become a factor.  Sponsors would jump on the idea in making more revenue and supporting an immense field (like NCAA’s March Madness).  There is going to be a time where a team would like to go 16-0 (like 2019 North Dakota State and 2025 Indiana), 17-0, 18-0 (like the 2007 New England Patriots before losing Super Bowl XLII), or perhaps maybe 19-0 and win a National Championship.  
    </p>
    <p>
      What all of them have in common is the everlasting passion.  Aiming to win a National Championship will never die.  Sponsors wanting to be an advocate will never go away.  The potential passion for finding the big revenue with a 32-team FBS Playoff is there.  So too is my dedication of making my postseason project work for everyone.  
    </p>
    <h3>Final Words</h3>
    <p>
      The concept of a 32-team FBS playoff has been independently proposed by
      multiple analysts over the past two decades. Kelly Martinez advocated for
      it in the Meridian Magazine as early as 2003. Walt Gekko (wallyhorse) has
      been a tireless advocate since
      <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091213004555/http://www.toosmarttofail.com/32teamplayoff.html"
        >December 2009</a
      >, keeping the conversation alive through
      <a href="https://wallyhorse.wordpress.com/?s=32-team+playoff"
        >annual updates</a
      >. His work at toosmarttofail.com (now archived) and his continued
      advocacy on wallyhorse.wordpress.com helped inspire this comprehensive
      proposal. This project builds on their foundation with comprehensive
      documentation and a complete 28-season historical analysis showing how the
      system would have worked from 1998-present. While our specific approaches
      differ, we share the same vision: a true national championship decided
      through a fair, inclusive 32-team playoff system.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few authors I would like to express gratitude first. Walt
      Gekko, I thank you for having the audacity to advocate for a 32-team field
      for Division I FBS. I thank you for not giving up on the 32-team field.
      Kelly Martinez, you deserve appreciation as well. I credit you for
      imagining outside the box at the time. I understood why the FBS was not
      open to a playoff back then. However, times have changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that some of you are not genuinely open to a 32-team field. I
      also understand that we are going to have disagreements. Is there still
      room for growth regarding my project? Absolutely. It’s not going to be the
      perfect project. However, all it takes is to demonstrate my dedication and
      show you all why I feel my project is the right place at the perfect time.
      I do not want anyone to walk away feeling that my project was useless and
      is not good enough to move Division I FBS forward in the long-term. I am
      always open to continue to improve my project and learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know anyone else other than Walt Gekko who has tirelessly pushed
      for a 32-team playoff since 2009? Do you know anyone else other than me
      who has dedicated their free time since September 2016 to make sure the
      solution is adaptable and is willing to adjust? You may think a fan’s
      passionate project may not carry as much weight as a conference
      commissioner who proposes a completely different system. However, I hope
      maybe my project will have at least some (or perhaps a lot of) meaning to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hope is that a 32-team field plus the potential secondary playoff
      system does not scare anyone away. Instead, I hope they can become a
      benefactor for the long-term, even in the changing collegiate landscape
      and being amiable with the NFL. I want everyone to walk away feeling the
      many years of effort, passion, and dedication I invested to explain what,
      how, and why a potential 32-team playoff field can become valuable for the
      FBS. If you have read everything and made it to the end, I thank you for
      your time.
