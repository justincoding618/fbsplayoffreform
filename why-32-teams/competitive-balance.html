    <h1>Competitive Balance</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of having half of the playoff field being seeded and the other
      half being unseeded is to still provide meaning to the regular season. A
      team will play out their regular season for seeding position. The better
      the seed, the better the opportunities for a deep postseason run.
    </p>
    <h2>Significance of Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Historical data demonstrates the tangible impact of home-field advantage. In the first round of the 12-team playoff, home teams went 6-2, showing how familiar surroundings, crowd support, and elimination of travel fatigue create measurable competitive edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's recall how home-field is determined for the first two rounds:
      <div id="homefield"></div>
      The difference between getting two guaranteed home games, one guaranteed home game, one non-guaranteed home game, and playing the first two rounds on the road is massive.  The top 8 seeds have a huge advantage because they would not need to travel for the first two rounds.  The top 16 seeds would be able to at least stay home in the first round.  However, if they want that second home game, they would need to root for the unseeded team that is facing a top 8 seed to pull off the upset.  Otherwise, they would be on the road in the second round against a top 8 seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unseeded teams are guaranteed road games for the first two rounds. However, they can earn a home game in round 2 under specific circumstances.  Let's consider an example scenario:
      <ul>
        <li>Unseeded Team A plays at the #8 seed (Round 1)</li>
        <li>Unseeded Team B plays at the #9 seed (Round 1)</li>
        <li>Unseeded Team A upsets the #8 seed AND Unseeded Team B upsets the #9 seed</li>
        <li>Result: These two unseeded teams face each other in Round 2</li>
        <li>Home field for this matchup is determined by their final regular season CFP ranking</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates an incentive for unseeded teams—win in Round 1, and you might host in Round 2 if your unseeded counterpart also pulls the upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the New Year's Bowl Games still being relevant for two of the final three rounds, being a seeded team has an added benefit.  The highest seeded teams in each quarterfinal matchup will get to select which New Year's Six Bowl Game to play at after the first two rounds.  The quarterfinals can either reseed or not reseed teams after the second round.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let's say the 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, and 16 seeds advance to the quarterfinals.  If there is no reseeding after the second round, the quarterfinal matchups would be the following:
      <ul>
        <li>QF Matchup 1: 6 seed vs 3 seed</li>
        <li>QF Matchup 2: 15 seed vs 7 seed</li>
        <li>QF Matchup 3: 13 seed vs 12 seed</li>
        <li>QF Matchup 4: 16 seed vs 9 seed</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For those given matchups, the 3 seed would get first choice.  The 7 seed would get second choice.  The 9 seed would get third choice, while the 12 seed would get the remaining bowl game that was not selected by the other three teams.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to reseed after the first two rounds, here is how it would look:
      <ul>
        <li>QF Matchup 1: 16 seed vs 3 seed</li>
        <li>QF Matchup 2: 15 seed vs 6 seed</li>
        <li>QF Matchup 3: 13 seed vs 7 seed</li>
        <li>QF Matchup 4: 12 seed vs 9 seed</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For those given matchups, the 3 seed would get first choice.  The 6 seed would get second choice.  The 7 seed would get third choice, while the 9 seed would get the remaining bowl game that was not selected by the other three teams.   
    </p>
    <h2>Proving Competitive Balance on the Field</h2>
    <p>The current system's limited access prevents us from truly knowing the competitive ceiling of non-power conference teams. Recent years have shown flashes of what's possible when these teams get opportunities:
      <ul>
        <li>Non-power FBS teams have competed closely with power conference opponents when given the chance</li>
        <li>The "eye test" argument assumes outcomes without allowing teams to prove themselves</li>
        <li>A 32-team field always guarantees opportunity, which must still be earned through performance</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The principle is simple: competitive balance must be proven on the field, not assumed in committee rooms.</b> If non-power conference teams truly can't compete, the seeded teams will handle them in the early rounds. However, if they CAN compete, the current system denies us the chance to ever find out.
    </p>
    <h2>Does 32 Teams "Dilute" the Playoffs?</h2>
    <p>
      Critics argue that expanding to 32 teams would dilute playoff quality by including teams that "don't belong." This argument fails on multiple fronts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Seeding protects quality:</b> The top 16 teams receive home-field advantage, creating a clear hierarchy that rewards regular season excellence. This provides structured competition.</li>
      <li><b>Access doesn't equal outcomes:</b> Including 32 teams doesn't mean all 32 have equal chances. It means all earned their opportunity through conference championships or at-large merit.</li>
      <li><b>March Madness precedent:</b> The NCAA basketball tournament includes 68 teams from a smaller sport population. Has this "diluted" the tournament? The first weekend is considered the most exciting sporting event of the year.</li>
      <li><b>Regular season still matters:</b> Teams still compete intensely for seeding position because the difference between a top-8 seed (two home games) and an unseeded position (two road games) is massive. You can learn more about <a href="/why-32-teams/regular-season-importance.html">why the regular season remains critically important</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The "dilution" argument is really an access argument in disguise.  It assumes only certain conferences deserve opportunities and works backward to justify exclusion.
    </p>
    <h2>Everyone Gets the Same Amount of Rest</h2>
    <p>
      Equal rest between all playoff teams is crucial for competitive balance. The current 12-team format has exposed how bye weeks create competitive disadvantages. In 2024, the top four conference champions received first-round byes and went 0-4 in the quarterfinals. In 2025, straight seeding was implemented but bye teams still struggled, going 1-3 in the quarterfinals.  Indiana was the only team to win after getting a bye that year.  They went on to complete the first 16-0 FBS season since 1894 Yale. Combined, teams with first-round byes have gone 1-7 in quarterfinals, suggesting that extended layoffs cause rhythm and timing issues that outweigh the physical rest benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 32-team format eliminates this problem entirely. Because we must accommodate the Army-Navy game, the stand-alone regular season finale gives the rest of the FBS at least one extra bye week. Since the recommended regular season solution eliminates conference championship games and has all teams end the regular season on the weekend before Thanksgiving (except Army and Navy), the 32-team field gives no byes to any team—everyone enters the playoff on equal footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>This creates true meritocracy:</b> success is determined by seeding position and performance, not by whether you had an advantageous or disadvantageous layoff period. For Army and Navy, they would still have their stand-alone rivalry game after Thanksgiving, giving them two bye weeks during the regular season. If either or both are selected in the playoff field, they play the next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result: <b>competitive balance is determined on the field based on preparation, talent, and execution—not scheduling quirks.</b> You can learn more in <a href="/proposed-process/conference-championship-flexibility.html">the alternative solution to keep conference championship games</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary: Balance Through Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff achieves competitive balance through three key mechanisms:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Seeding rewards excellence:</b> Top teams earn significant home-field advantages and bowl selection rights</li>
        <li><b>Equal rest ensures fairness:</b> No team gains or loses competitive edge through scheduling disparities</li>
        <li><b>Access enables meritocracy:</b> All conference champions can prove themselves on the field, while 22 at-large bids ensure deserving teams aren't excluded</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't about making the playoffs "easier".  <b>What it does instead is making them <i>fair</i>.</b> The best teams still have clear advantages. The difference is that competitive balance is determined through structured competition, not committee assumptions.
