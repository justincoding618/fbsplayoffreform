      <h1>Regular Season Importance</h1>

      <h2>The Common Objection</h2>
      <p>
        A common objection that critics claim is the following:<br />
        <b
          >"Won't expanding to 32 teams make the regular season meaningless?"</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This objection misunderstands how seeding works and ignores the
        empirical evidence from other divisions of college football that already
        use larger playoff formats. The regular season doesn't become
        meaningless—it becomes more important because every game affects
        seeding, and seeding determines everything about a team's playoff path.
      </p>

      <h2>Evidence from Other Divisions</h2>

      <h3>Division III: 32-Team and 40-Team Playoffs</h3>
      <p>
        Division III has run a 32-team playoff from 2005-2023 and expanded to a
        40-team playoff in 2024, yet their regular season remains fiercely
        competitive. Why? Because there's an enormous difference between being a
        top seed with home-field advantage throughout the playoffs versus being
        a lower seed forced to travel for every game.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Division III's 40-team format, the top overall seeds of four regions
        receive first-round byes and host games through the regional finals.
        Teams seeded 3-4 in each region host second-round games but must travel
        to face top seeds in the third round. The regular season determines who
        gets these massive advantages—teams fight for every win because the
        difference between being #1 and #3 in your region means an extra home
        game and avoiding the top seed until later rounds
      </p>

      <h3>Division II: 32-Team Playoff</h3>
      <p>
        Division II expanded to a 32-team playoff in 2025 and provides even more
        compelling evidence. In 2025, Harding went 11-0 in the regular season,
        earned the #1 seed in their super regional, hosted three consecutive
        playoff games, and was reseeded as the #3 overall seed for the
        semifinals. Ferris State also went 11-0, earned the #1 seed in their
        super regional, hosted three playoff games, was reseeded as the #1
        overall seed for the semifinals, and hosted the semifinal game at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        The regular season determined everything about their playoff experience.
        Both teams fought through undefeated regular seasons specifically to
        earn home-field advantage. Teams that finished 9-2 or 8-3 still made the
        playoff but had to travel on the road, facing much more difficult paths.
        The regular season mattered enormously because seeding created tangible,
        massive competitive advantages.
      </p>

      <h3>FCS: 24-Team Playoff</h3>
      <p>
        The FCS uses a 24-team playoff format with eight teams receiving
        first-round byes and automatic home games through the quarterfinals if
        they keep winning. FCS teams desperately compete for top-8 seeds because
        the alternative—playing an extra first-round game on the road—is a
        significant disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        North Dakota State's dynasty (winning nine FCS championships from
        2011-2021) was built partly on regular season excellence that earned
        them top seeds and home playoff games. Their regular seasons were
        intensely competitive because they knew seeding determined whether
        they'd host playoff games in the brutal North Dakota winter (a massive
        home-field advantage) or travel to warmer climates to face opponents in
        hostile environments.
      </p>

      <h2>Why the Regular Season Remains Critical</h2>

      <h3>Seeding Creates Enormous Stakes</h3>
      <p>
        In a 32-team playoff, the difference between the #1 seed and #16 seed
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            >Two guaranteed home games vs one home game (or zero for unseeded
            teams):</b
          >
          Home-field advantage in college football is worth approximately 3-4
          points per game according to advanced analytics
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Facing the lowest unseeded team vs facing the highest unseeded
            team:</b
          >
          Playing the absolute weakest team in the playoff vs a quality at-large
          selection
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Much easier path to championship:</b> Top seeds face weaker
          opponents longer into the playoff, while lower seeds must upset elite
          teams immediately
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Example scenario:</b> Indiana finishes the regular season ranked #1,
        while USC finishes #16. Indiana gets two guaranteed home games and would
        face the lowest unseeded team (likely a 4 or 5-loss non-power FBS
        conference champion) in round one. If Indiana wins, they host the winner
        of #16 vs the top unseeded team (who would be ranked #17) in round
        two—still likely winnable at home. If they reach the quarterfinals, they
        get first choice of New Year's Six bowl location.
      </p>
      <p>
        USC, despite making the playoff, gets only one home game and hosts the
        top unseeded team in round one. If USC wins, they must travel to face
        the #1 seed on the road in round two (given that the #1 seed takes care
        of business). Would you rather be Indiana or USC?
      </p>

      <h3>Conference Championships Still Matter</h3>
      <p>
        Winning your conference championship guarantees an automatic bid to the
        playoff. However, conference champions still compete intensely for
        seeding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An undefeated or 1-loss power conference champion is a shoe-in for a
          top 8 seed, gaining two guaranteed home games
        </li>
        <li>
          A 2-loss power conference champion has a chance of earning a top 8
          seed, getting two guaranteed home games, or be a top 16 seed, meaning
          at least one guaranteed home game
        </li>
        <li>
          A 3-loss power conference champion has a chance of earning a top 16
          seed, gaining at least one home game, have a slim chance of a top 8
          seed, which would give them two guaranteed home games, or be one of
          the top unseeded teams, meaning no home games and facing a top seed on
          the road immediately
        </li>
        <li>
          A power conference champion with four losses or more would be one of
          the unseeded teams, meaning no home games and facing a top seed on the
          road immediately
        </li>
        <li>
          An undefeated, 1-loss, or 2-loss non-power FBS conference champion
          getting a top 16 seed or not depends on the overall body of work.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Undefeated or 1-loss non power FBS conference champions have an
              outside shot of a top 8 seed, which would give them two home
              games. Otherwise, they could either be a top 16 seed, getting at
              least one home game but get a tougher second-round matchup
              (regardless of at home or on the road), or be one of the top
              unseeded teams, meaning no home games and facing a top seed on the
              road immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              2-loss non-power FBS conference champions can either be a top 16
              seed, getting at least one home game but get a tougher
              second-round matchup (regardless of at home or on the road), or be
              one of the top unseeded teams, meaning no home games and facing a
              top seed on the road immediately
            </li>
            <li>
              Let's look at a few examples:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  2023 Liberty went undefeated but played the weakest schedule
                  in FBS. They were ranked #23 in the final CFP rankings just
                  slightly ahead of 2-loss American (formerly AAC) Champion SMU.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2024 Boise State went 12-1 as Mountain West champion and was
                  ranked #9 after playing three power conference
                  opponents—Oregon (Big Ten), Washington State, and Oregon State
                  (both still Pac-12 members at the time, though they will
                  transition to the rebuilt non-power Pac-12 starting in 2026)
                  with their only loss being a close game to then #1 Oregon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2025 James Madison went 12-1 and won the Sun Belt. However,
                  they were ranked only #24 in the final CFP rankings behind
                  11-2 Tulane. Tulane played a significantly stronger
                  non-conference schedule with three power conference opponents
                  (Northwestern, Duke, Ole Miss) compared to JMU's single power
                  conference game (against Louisville). Despite having one more
                  loss, Tulane's schedule strength earned them a higher ranking,
                  demonstrating that non-power conference champions must
                  schedule aggressively to compete for top seeds.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          A conference champion from a non-power FBS conference with at least
          three losses is likely unseeded, meaning no home games and facing a
          top seed on the road immediately
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A power conference champion is a shoe-in for a top 16 seed as long as
        they take care of business and not lose more than three games. For
        non-power FBS conference champions, the schedule strength separates
        getting a top 16 seed and becoming unseeded. 2024 Boise State went 12-1
        as Mountain West champion and was ranked #9 after playing three power
        conference opponents (Oregon, Washington State, Oregon State) with their
        only regular season loss being a close game to then-#1 Oregon. In
        contrast, 2025 James Madison went 12-1 as Sun Belt champion but was
        ranked only #24 after playing just one power opponent (Louisville) and
        lacking quality wins. 2023 Liberty went undefeated in the regular
        season, but played the weakest schedule in the FBS. In a 32-team
        playoff, Boise State would likely earn a top-16 seed with at least one
        home game, while Liberty and JMU would likely be unseeded and face a top
        seed on the road immediately—despite identical and/or better records.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between going undefeated, only losing once or twice, and
        losing 3 or more games as a power or non-power conference champion is
        enormous. Home-field advantage and opponent quality change dramatically
        based on those three additional wins.
      </p>

      <h3>Quality Wins Are Critical</h3>
      <p>
        The selection committee ranks all 32 playoff teams, and seeding is
        determined by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overall record and strength of schedule</li>
        <li>Quality wins (especially against top-25 opponents)</li>
        <li>Avoiding bad losses (particularly to teams outside the top 100)</li>
        <li>Performance in conference play</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Playing tough non-conference games improves playoff positioning. A team
        that schedules challenging opponents and goes 10-2 with wins over ranked
        teams will earn a better seed than a team that goes 11-1 against a weak
        schedule. Running up the score against cupcakes doesn't help seeding—the
        committee values quality wins over hollow statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incentivizes teams to schedule aggressively rather than padding
        records. The current system discourages tough non-conference games
        because one loss can eliminate playoff hopes entirely. A 32-team playoff
        rewards teams for taking risks in scheduling because even an 11-1 or
        10-2 team with quality wins makes the field—and earns better seeding
        than an 11-1 team that avoided competition.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparison to Other Successful Playoff Systems</h2>

      <h3>March Madness (68 Teams)</h3>
      <p>
        College basketball's regular season is hugely important despite 68 of
        362 Division I teams making the NCAA Tournament (nearly 19%). Why?
        Seeding. The difference between a #1 seed and a #8 seed is massive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          #1 seeds win the national championship approximately 25% of the time
        </li>
        <li>#2-4 seeds combine for about 50% of championships</li>
        <li>
          #8 seeds or lower almost never win it all (twice in tournament
          history)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Teams fight desperately for every regular season win to improve their
        seed, even after clinching tournament berths. The same dynamic would
        exist in a 32-team college football playoff.
      </p>

      <h3>NFL Playoffs (14 Teams)</h3>
      <p>
        The NFL playoffs include 14 of 32 teams (43.75% of the league), yet NFL
        regular seasons remain intensely competitive. Teams battle for division
        championships, first-round byes (for top seeds), and home-field
        advantage throughout the playoffs. The difference between the #1 seed
        and #7 seed is enormous:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          #1 seed gets a first-round bye and hosts every playoff game until the
          Super Bowl
        </li>
        <li>
          #7 seed plays an extra game on the road and must win three straight
          road games to reach the Super Bowl
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NFL teams with first-round byes and home-field advantage win
        championships at vastly higher rates than wild card teams. This creates
        immense regular season stakes even for teams that have already clinched
        playoff spots.
      </p>

      <h2>The False Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        The claim that a 32-team playoff makes the regular season meaningless is
        a false narrative perpetuated by those who favor the current system or
        smaller playoff formats. The evidence proves otherwise:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Division III (40 teams), Division II (32 teams), and FCS (24 teams)
          all have highly competitive regular seasons
        </li>
        <li>
          March Madness (68 teams) has one of the most watched and celebrated
          regular seasons in sports
        </li>
        <li>
          The NFL (14 of 32 teams) has the highest television ratings in
          American sports for regular season games
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In every successful playoff system, larger fields increase regular
        season intensity because seeding creates enormous competitive
        advantages. The 32-team college football playoff would follow this
        proven model.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Expansion is Inevitable</h2>
      <p>
        You could argue that a 32-team playoff faces the same concerns as
        smaller formats about regular season importance. However, with the
        correct selection method and seeding structure, it thrives. Eventually,
        college football will expand to 32 teams. Even a 24-team playoff would
        face pressure to grow as conferences continue realigning and adding
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >The longer expansion to 32 teams is delayed, the more inevitable it
          becomes.</b
        >
        The current 12-team format is already too small for a landscape with two
        super power conferences. Waiting only makes the eventual transition more
        disruptive. Implementing 32 teams now creates a stable, long-term
        solution that accommodates all conferences while maintaining regular
        season intensity through meaningful seeding.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The regular season remains critically important in a 32-team playoff
        because seeding determines everything—home-field advantage, opponent
        difficulty, and path to the championship. Division II and Division III
        have proven that larger playoff fields increase regular season intensity
        rather than diminish it. Teams fight desperately for every win because
        the difference between being a top seed with multiple home games and
        being an unseeded team traveling on the road is enormous. The 32-team
        format makes every regular season game matter for positioning, just as
        it does in March Madness, the NFL playoffs, and every other successful
        postseason system in American sports. Seeding creates stakes, and stakes
        create compelling regular seasons.
