    <h1>Preserving FBS Unity</h1>
    <p>
      The greatest threat to college football is the possibility that the SEC
      and Big Ten might abandon the rest of FBS entirely and form their own
      super league. Once dismissed as fear-mongering, this scenario has become
      increasingly plausible as the two mega-conferences have leveraged
      breakaway threats to gain control over the College Football Playoff.
      However, would they actually follow through? This analysis examines the
      breakaway threat from every angle: 
      <ul>
        <li>Its credibility and history as a negotiating tactic</li>
        <li>Concrete super league proposals that have been developed</li>
        <li>Fatal legal and structural flaws that would doom any breakaway attempt</li>
        <li>Economic reality that unity generates more revenue than fragmentation</li>
        <li>Catastrophic impact on fan engagement and college sports culture</li>
        <li>Political obstacles that mega-conferences cannot overcome</li>
        <li>Why the 32-team playoff format serves as the only viable insurance policy against college football's fragmentation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakaway threat is real enough to be dangerous.  However, executing it would be catastrophic for everyone involved, including the SEC and Big Ten themselves.
    </p>
    <h2>Breakaway Threat Level: Real or Bluff?</h2>
    <p>
      The specter of an SEC-Big Ten breakaway from the rest of FBS football haunts every conversation about playoff expansion. As Jon Wilner of the San Jose Mercury News observed in June 2025, "The two conferences leveraged the threat of creating their own postseason into control of the College Football Playoff format in 2026 and beyond because the other leagues didn't call their bluff." Multiple sources confirm that the SEC and Big Ten have considered breaking away. The biggest question is whether they would actually follow through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The threat appears more credible than ever. SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey has publicly declared, "They want to be us, and that's on me to bring myself back to earth." Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti echoed similar sentiment: "I have yet to see a single thing in any plan that contains things that we couldn't do ourselves and do with our [Power Four] colleagues." Both commissioners clearly believe their conferences don't need the other eight FBS conferences to succeed financially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the infrastructure for breakaway already exists in some conferences. The ACC's amended revenue distribution agreement, finalized in 2025, includes a remarkable escape clause: schools can leave for a football-only conference at half the usual exit fee if six or more members exit together. As CBS Sports reported, "In other words, the foundation for a breakaway league may already exist."
    </p>
    <h2>Super League Proposals</h2>
    <p>
      Concrete proposals for potential breakways have circulated. College Sports Tomorrow (CST), a group including Syracuse chancellor Kent Syverud and Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, has pitched a 70-team "super league" since 2023. According to documents obtained by Sportico, the proposal includes $9 billion in upfront private equity investment from Smash Capital, with the league generating at least $15 billion in revenue over its first 12 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CST proposal would organize 70 "permanent members", which would consist of all Power Conference schools plus Notre Dame.  The 70 teams would be split into seven 10-team geographically aligned divisions. Players would receive revenue sharing through a "Broadcast NIL" system, with 5% going to freshmen, 15% to sophomores, 30% to juniors, and 50% to seniors. A 16-team playoff would determine the champion, with potential expansion to 24 teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      A 2021 Nelson's estimate suggested that a 32-team super league could generate two and a half times more television revenue for SEC and Big Ten schools than they currently receive, with the figure rising to five times more for Pac-12 and ACC schools. The economic incentive for elite brands is undeniable.
    </p>
    <h2>Breakaway's Fatal Flaws</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the apparent financial incentives, a breakaway faces insurmountable obstacles that would make it catastrophic for even the SEC and Big Ten.
    </p>
    <h3>The Antitrust Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike the NFL, college sports do not enjoy an antitrust exemption. The Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which allows the NFL to sell media rights collectively, doesn't apply to college programs. Any attempt by the SEC and Big Ten to form a closed super league that excludes half of FBS would immediately face antitrust challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Michael Nevarez, a sports law expert, told CBS Sports: "But that would require an antitrust exemption." The NCAA has lobbied Congress for years seeking such an exemption, spending millions on advocacy, yet no bill has advanced to a vote. The SCORE Act making its way through Congress in 2025 might provide breakthrough legislation, but progress remains uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without an antitrust exemption, a breakaway league risks immediate legal action. The five major players associations (MLBPA, NBPA, NFLPA, NHLPA, MLSPA) issued a joint statement in July 2025 opposing any antitrust exemption for college sports, arguing it would "give the green light for the organization and schools to collude and work against student athletes." If even professional sports unions oppose protecting college sports from antitrust liability, what chance does a breakaway league have in court?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court's unanimous (9-0) decision in NCAA v. Alston (2021) made clear that the NCAA is subject to antitrust laws. Justice Brett Kavanaugh's concurrence warned that "there remain serious questions about the NCAA's remaining compensation rules." A super league that creates a closed system excluding schools based on arbitrary criteria—particularly one that locks out entire conferences and geographic regions—would face immediate Sherman Act challenges.
    </p>
    <h3>The NCAA Dependency</h3>
    <p>
      ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips articulated another fundamental problem in June 2025: Breaking away from the NCAA would mean "abandoning core structures like medical research, officiating, rules enforcement and academic oversight." The NCAA, despite its many flaws, provides essential infrastructure that individual conferences cannot easily replicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breakway league would have to create the following from scratch:
      <ul>
        <li>Medical research programs and injury protocols</li>
        <li>Officiating training and evaluation systems</li>
        <li>Rule interpretations and enforcement mechanisms</li>
        <li>Drug testing and compliance programs</li>
        <li>Academic eligibility standards and monitoring</li>
        <li>Championship infrastructure for 20+ Olympic sports</li>
        <li>Title IX compliance oversight</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The costs of duplicating these systems would be enormous, and the legal liability of operating them independently would be staggering. When the NCAA faces lawsuits over safety issues or eligibility rules, it distributes liability across hundreds of institutions. A super league of 30-70 schools would bear concentrated liability for any policy failures.
    </p>
    <h3>The Olympic Sports Catastrophe</h3>
    <p>
      A football-only breakaway would devastate Olympic sports programs that currently depend on football revenue. The vast majority of athletic departments lose money on non-revenue sports, subsidizing them with football and basketball earnings. If elite football programs break away and keep all their revenue, what happens to swimming, track, volleyball, soccer, and the 20+ other sports that generate minimal revenue?
    </p>
    <p>
      The numbers tell a stark story. According to recent Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act data, Arizona State's football program generated $40.2 million in revenue, while all other male and female sports combined (excluding basketball) generated $40.6 million. At most major universities, football revenues subsidize everything else. A breakaway that severs football from the broader athletic department would financially strangle Olympic sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's already happening under the House v. NCAA settlement that allows revenue sharing with athletes. Schools like Louisiana-Monroe and Washington State have already shuttered Olympic sport programs citing the costs of the new revenue-sharing model. If universities struggle to maintain Olympic sports while football remains part of their athletic departments, how would they survive if football revenue disappeared entirely into a separate super league?
    </p>
    <p>
      Title IX creates additional complexity. Federal law requires equitable treatment of men's and women's sports. The Department of Education confirmed in July 2024 that Title IX will apply to revenue-sharing payments to athletes. If a super league pays football players millions while women's sports and Olympic programs wither from lack of funding, Title IX lawsuits would be immediate and inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House settlement was specifically structured to protect against Title IX challenges by keeping football within the broader athletic department framework and allowing revenue to flow to all sports. As Title IX lawyer Arthur Bryant told multiple outlets, separating football entirely "creates Title IX violations" by making it impossible to demonstrate equitable distribution of athletic opportunities and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The U.S. Olympic program depends heavily on college athletics for athlete development. Sixty-five percent of the 2024 U.S. Olympic Team were current or former NCAA varsity athletes. The 2024 team won 126 total medals, leading the medal count for the eighth consecutive Summer Olympics. Destroying the Olympic sports pipeline would create political opposition from constituencies far beyond college football fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federal policy has increasingly emphasized protecting non-revenue college sports. In July 2025, an executive order titled "Saving College Sports" directed universities with over $125 million in annual athletics revenue to "provide more scholarship opportunities in non-revenue sports" and "provide the maximum number of roster spots for non-revenue sports permitted." Regardless of one's political views, the directive demonstrates that protecting Olympic sports programs has become a federal priority. A super league that abandons these programs would face scrutiny from government officials across the political spectrum who recognize the importance of Olympic sport development to American competitiveness on the world stage.
    </p>
    <h3>The Fan Engagement Problem</h3>
    <p>
      The economic projections for super leagues assume that fan interest would remain constant or increase if all elite teams played in one league. This assumption is highly questionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      College football's unique appeal lies in its regional identity, tradition, and the possibility of upsets. A Georgia fan's investment in the sport comes partly from beating Florida, Auburn, and Tennessee—rivals they've played for generations. Would that fan care as much about a playoff game against a Big Ten opponent they have no historical connection to?
    </p>
    <p>
      European football's proposed Super League provides a cautionary tale. In April 2021, twelve elite clubs from England, Spain, and Italy announced a breakaway league that would guarantee permanent membership for founding clubs, eliminating the sporting merit that defines European football. The reaction was immediate and devastating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within 48 hours, the European Super League collapsed completely. Chelsea fans blocked their team's bus outside Stamford Bridge before a match, with legendary goalkeeper Petr Cech pleading with supporters to let the bus through. Manchester United fans staged massive protests. A YouGov poll showed only 14% of fans supported the Super League. Players, managers, and coaches publicly opposed it. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to "drop a legislative bomb" on the project. By Tuesday evening, all six English clubs had withdrawn, and the league was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ESPN reported, "The backlash wasn't limited to public opinion" - the clubs "didn't seem to have any PR going on alongside the announcement. The website seemed rushed. The whole thing seemed a bit half-baked." According to research published in the European Sport Management Quarterly, the collapse demonstrated how "digital publics can overpower corporate strategies" when organizations ignore stakeholder emotions and shared values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson is clear: fans saw the Super League as "a blatant cash grab that threatened the core values of European football," according to analysis from multiple universities. The permanent membership structure "undermined the competitive fairness that has long defined football competitions." As Professor Cornel Sandvoss noted, "Being a fan serves as a fixed point" in people's identities, and clubs that betray fan values lose that connection irreparably.
    </p>
    <p>
      College football fans have shown identical sentiment. When Texas and Oklahoma left the Big 12 for the SEC, fans lamented the death of rivalries with Oklahoma State, Texas Tech, and other Big 12 schools. When USC and UCLA abandoned the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, West Coast fans expressed anger at destroying a 100-year-old conference for television money.
    </p>
    <p>
      A super league that completely breaks from the traditional conference structure would face the same fan revolt that destroyed the European Super League. Alumni donations—a major revenue source for athletic departments—could plummet if donors feel their school has betrayed its identity and traditions. Season ticket holders might not renew if half their home games are against teams they've never played before and have no emotional connection to. As the European experience proved, no amount of projected television revenue can compensate for alienating your core fanbase.
    </p>
    <h3>Media Rights Reality Check</h3>
    <p>
      The assumption that a 30-70 team super league would generate vastly more television revenue than the current system deserves skepticism. Yes, concentrating all elite brands in one league might increase per-game viewership for marquee matchups. But it would also eliminate many of the compelling narratives that drive college football interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the 2025 season: would the regular season have been as interesting if undefeated Cincinnati (American Conference) couldn't dream of making a playoff? What about Boise State's remarkable season—would anyone care if the Mountain West champion had no path to the championship? The possibility of Cinderella stories and underdog runs creates drama that keeps casual fans engaged throughout the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      A closed super league also reduces inventory value. Currently, networks pay premium rates for college football because virtually every conference game matters for playoff positioning. If only 30 teams are competing for a championship, games involving the other 100+ FBS programs become significantly less valuable. The overall media rights value of college football as a whole would likely decrease, even if the super league itself commands higher per-game rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks has publicly supported playoff expansion to 24 teams, stating "I don't see any reason why the CFP can't be 24 teams." Why would a major broadcast partner advocate for expansion if they believed a smaller, closed system would be more profitable? Networks understand that college football's value comes from its breadth and regional diversity, not just from concentrating elite brands.
    </p>
    <h3>Political Backlash</h3>
    <p>
      A super league that excludes schools from entire states would trigger political opposition that the SEC and Big Ten are ill-prepared to handle. College football programs are often the most visible representation of state universities. Governors, state legislators, and members of Congress would face enormous constituent pressure to protect their state's programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      State universities receive public funding. Legislators might respond to a breakaway by cutting funding to athletic departments, changing how schools can spend athletic revenue, or passing laws restricting participation in breakaway leagues. The threat of political intervention is not hypothetical—several states passed NIL laws before the NCAA changed its policy, forcing the organization's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congressional intervention is even more likely. Multiple members of Congress have held hearings on college sports issues and proposed legislation on NIL, athlete employment, and antitrust matters. While these bills haven't advanced, that's partly because the college sports industry has fragile consensus. A breakaway attempt would shatter that consensus and likely spur federal action.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Patrick Crakes, a former FOX Sports executive, warned: "You can't ambush the government. That's the thing that's going to stop this. I've always maintained that one of the risks in investing in college sports is you're dealing with all the peculiarities of one of the most important qualitative assets in every state's portfolio—the state universities and athletic departments, plus the federal government."
    </p>
    <h2>Unity is More Profitable</h2>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten leaders must confront the following paradox: <b>Breaking away might seem lucrative in isolation, but it would likely generate less total revenue than a unified FBS system with an expanded playoff.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A 32-team playoff that keeps all of FBS together could generate $550+ million annually in distribution, as detailed in the main proposal. This revenue comes from 31 playoff games, each carrying significant television value because they're elimination games with conference pride and championship implications on the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A super league playoff with the same 30-40 teams every year would initially command high television rates, but those rates would likely decline over time as the novelty wears off and casual fans disengage. The NFL's playoff ratings remain strong because the regular season creates compelling narratives about which teams earned their way in—the same dynamic wouldn't exist in a closed college super league.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, the SEC and Big Ten would forfeit hundreds of millions in cross-conference matchup value. Georgia vs. Ohio State in a 32-team playoff quarterfinal is must-see television. Georgia vs. Ohio State in the fifth week of a super league regular season when both teams might finish 8-4 is just another game. The playoff structure creates stakes that regular season games in a super league cannot match.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten would also lose leverage in media negotiations. Currently, networks compete fiercely for SEC and Big Ten rights because losing one conference to a competitor is catastrophic. In a super league scenario, there's only one entity to negotiate with, eliminating competitive bidding. History shows that monopolies rarely maximize revenue in the long run—competitive marketplaces do.
    </p>
    <h2>32-Team Playoff as Breakaway Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff format functions as insurance against breakaway scenarios by making unity more valuable than separation. Under the proposed structure:
      <h3>The SEC and Big Ten get everything they actually need:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6-8 teams in the playoff (potentially more in exceptional years)</li>
        <li>Massive revenue through performance-based distribution</li>
        <li>Home playoff games for top seeds</li>
        <li>Complete competitive control through seeding advantages</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>They also get benefits they'd lose in a breakaway:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cross-conference matchup value (SEC vs. Big Ten games become playoff elimination battles)</li>
        <li>Narrative diversity (Cinderella stories that keep casual fans engaged)</li>
        <li>Political cover (all conferences have access, reducing government intervention risk)</li>
        <li>Legal protection (avoiding antitrust challenges by maintaining inclusive structure)</li>
        <li>Cost savings (NCAA infrastructure remains available rather than building duplicates)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The format makes breakaway economically irrational. Yes, the SEC and Big Ten would control a larger percentage of revenue in a super league. However, they would be splitting a smaller overall pie, facing massive legal costs, alienating portions of their fanbase, and risking political intervention. The 32-team playoff offers them the same financial upside without any of those downsides.
    </p>
    <h2>Why the Threat Persists Despite the Risks</h2>
    <p>
      If breaking away is such a bad idea, why do SEC and Big Ten commissioners keep threatening it? The SEC and Big Ten utilize this as a negotiating tactic that has worked brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jon Wilner noted, the threat of a breakaway gave the SEC and Big Ten control over the CFP format in 2024 without actually having to execute the breakaway. The other conferences, terrified of being excluded, "handed over control" through the memorandum of understanding. The SEC and Big Ten achieved their goal—veto power over playoff decisions—by threatening something they likely never intended to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The threat remains valuable as long as other conferences believe it might be real. However, there is a limit to how many times you can threaten to walk away before people call your bluff. The longer the SEC and Big Ten deadlock each other without reaching agreement on a format, the more the other conferences might realize that the breakaway threat is hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why the 32-team playoff becomes increasingly attractive to SEC and Big Ten leadership.  The 32-team playoff provides a face-saving way to end the impasse while claiming victory. Both conferences can point to concrete wins (multiple teams in the playoff, revenue based on performance, home field advantages) without having to execute a breakaway strategy that deep down, they probably know would be disastrous.
    </p>
    <h2>Can College Football Remain One Sport?</h2>
    <p>
      The unity versus breakaway debate ultimately asks whether college football can survive as a single, coherent sport when power and resources are so unevenly distributed. Can we create a system where power conference teams like Alabama and non-power FBS teams like Tulane both play Division I FBS football, even though Alabama generates 20 times the revenue?
    </p>
    <p>
      History suggests the answer is yes, but only if the system provides enough value to both ends of the spectrum.  Power conference teams like Alabama needs elite competition, massive revenue, and legitimate paths to championships. Non-power FBS teams like Tulane needs access to bowl games, occasional paycheck games against elite opponents, and the prestige of competing at the highest level. A well-designed system provides both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff accomplishes this by creating abundance rather than scarcity. There's room for the SEC and Big Ten to dominate the at-large landscape in the playoff AND for the non-power FBS conference champions to earn automatic bids. There's revenue for elite programs to pay players millions AND for smaller programs to maintain their athletic departments. There's competitive integrity through seeding AND access for all conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breakaway league, by contrast, creates a permanent underclass. Schools left out would eventually wither, their best players and coaches would migrate to the super league. Within a decade, you'd have de facto two separate sports: super league football and everyone else. The broader sport would be diminished, fan interest would fragment, and the total economic pie would shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      College football has survived this long because it's maintained the fiction that any team, in any conference, on any Saturday, could beat anyone else. Cinderella stories like Appalachian State beating Michigan, Boise State beating Oklahoma, TCU's, Utah's, and UCF's undefeated seasons, as well as Cincinnati making the 4-team College Football Playoff remind fans why college football is special. A super league would trade that magic for short-term revenue maximization, and the sport would never recover.
    </p>
    <h2>It Is Worth Calling the Breakaway as a Bluff</h2>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten will not break away from FBS football. The legal obstacles are too severe, the political risks too high, the financial benefits too uncertain, and the damage to the sport's appeal too catastrophic. The breakaway threat is a negotiating tactic, not a serious strategic plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the fact that the threat exists at all reveals college football's existential crisis. If the two most powerful conferences feel compelled to threaten breakaway to get what they want, the system is broken. The current impasse, where no playoff format can gain consensus, is unsustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 32-team playoff offers an exit from this crisis. It gives the SEC and Big Ten everything they need without requiring them to destroy the sport they claim to value. It preserves FBS unity while acknowledging power imbalances. It's not perfect for anyone, but it's good enough for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternative—continued deadlock, escalating threats, eventual fragmentation—benefits no one. The SEC and Big Ten might win the battle for playoff control, but they'd lose the war for college football's soul. And in the end, they'd discover that controlling a diminished sport is far less valuable than sharing a vibrant one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice is clear: embrace a 32-team playoff that keeps college football united, or gamble on a breakaway that could destroy everything that makes the sport worth watching. The SEC and Big Ten have the power to decide. One can only hope they choose wisely.
