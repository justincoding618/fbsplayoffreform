  <h1>Revenue Distribution</h1>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <b>DISCLAIMER: This section is only my judgement of the potential in how much a 32-team field can potentially make for all of Division I FBS.  The reality can become different from the predictions.</b>
    </div>
    <p>
      The current College Football Playoff format still distributes revenue for all the bowl games from Mid-December to early January.  Since the bowl games are still involved as consolation games and/or playoff hosts, that can serve as potential additional revenue for any highly ranked/seeded playoff participants.  Otherwise, the 32-team playoff could still earn more potential revenue than any format below 32 teams.   The payout of the bowl games would be a bit different than the current payouts of the College Football Playoff.  Teams would receive the following payout for their success in the playoffs:
      <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Playoff Round</th>
        <th>FBS Conferences and Notre Dame</th>
        <th>Other FBS Independents</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>First Round</td>
        <td>$7M</td>
        <td>$5M</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Second Round</td>
        <td>$9M</td>
        <td>$7.5M</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Quarterfinals</td>
        <td>$12M</td>
        <td>$10M</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Semifinals</td>
        <td>$14M</td>
        <td>$11M</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>National Championship</td>
        <td>$18M</td>
        <td>$15M</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    The payout distribution for each of the New Year's Six Bowl Games depends on which ones would be hosting the quarterfinals as well as the semifinals.  LEt's take a look at each of the payouts that could happen.

    <h2>3-Year Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways we can do the 3-year cycle.  Let's break down each of them.
    </p>
    <h3>Version A</h3>  
    <p>
      The first way would use the BCS bowl lineup from 1998-2013 and make the Cotton Bowl and Peach Bowl as permanent Quarterfinal Games.  For FBS conferneces and Notre Dame, the revenue distribution is the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Year</th>
          <th>Rose Bowl</th>
          <th>Sugar Bowl</th>
          <th>Orange Bowl</th>
          <th>Fiesta Bowl</th>
          <th>Cotton Bowl</th>
          <th>Peach Bowl</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year A</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year B</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year C</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      For the other FBS Independents, it would look like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Year</th>
          <th>Rose Bowl</th>
          <th>Sugar Bowl</th>
          <th>Orange Bowl</th>
          <th>Fiesta Bowl</th>
          <th>Cotton Bowl</th>
          <th>Peach Bowl</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year A</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year B</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year C</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$11M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      The Rose Bowl would have a payout of $14M to each FBS conference team and Notre Dame every year since they would be hosting the semifinal game every year.  For the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl, they would be in the rotation for the following:
      <ul>
        <li>$14M payout as a semifinal game and $12M payout as a quarterfinals game to each FBS Conference team and Notre Dame</li>
        <li>$11M payout as a semifinal game and $10M payout as a quarterfinals game to each non-Notre Dame FBS Independent</li>
      </ul>
      The Peach Bowl and Cotton Bowl would only give the following payouts:
      <ul>
        <li>$12M payout as a quarterfinals game to each FBS Conference team and Notre Dame</li>
        <li>$10M payout as a quarterfinals game to each non-Notre Dame FBS Independent</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Version B</h3>
    <p>
      The second way of doing the 3-year cycle would use the 1937 major bowl lineup from 1998-2013 and make the Peach Bowl and Fiesta Bowl as permanent Quarterfinal Games.  For FBS conferneces and Notre Dame, the revenue distribution is the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Year</th>
          <th>Rose Bowl</th>
          <th>Sugar Bowl</th>
          <th>Orange Bowl</th>
          <th>Cotton Bowl</th>
          <th>Peach Bowl</th>
          <th>Fiesta Bowl</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year A</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year B</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$14M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year C</td>
          <td>$14M</td>

          <td>$12M</td>
          <td>$12M</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      For the other FBS Independents, it would look like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Year</th>
          <th>Rose Bowl</th>
          <th>Sugar Bowl</th>

          <td>$10M</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      The Rose Bowl would still have a payout of $14M to each FBS conference team and Notre Dame every year since they would be hosting the semifinal game every year.  For the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Cotton Bowl, they would be in the rotation for the following:

      </ul>
      The Peach Bowl and Fiesta Bowl would only give the following payouts:

        <li>$12M payout as a quarterfinals game to each FBS Conference team and Notre Dame</li>
        <li>$10M payout as a quarterfinals game to each non-Notre Dame FBS Independent</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>4-Year Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      The Cotton Bowl would join the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl for the revenue distribution while being a rotational quarterfinal and rotational semifinal game.  For FBS Conferences and Notre Dame, the payouts would look like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>

    The total distribution (without a non-Notre Dame Independent) for each round would be the following:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Playoff Round</th>
        <th>Number of Teams</th>

    The revenue distribution would work as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Conferences accumulate all earnings from their teams' performance </li>
      <li> Each conference distributes according to their own media deal agreements</li>
      <li> Example: A conference that has 6 teams advancing to the second round would earn $54M for that round alone</li>
      </ul>
    Here are the advantages:
    <ul>
      <li>Performance-based: Rewards competitive success</li>
      <li>Scalable: Deep playoff runs = exponentially higher earnings</li>
      <li>Conference incentives: More bids + advancement = more conference revenue</li>
      <li>Maintains competitive balance: non-power FBS auto-bids ensure access; power conference depth earns at-large majority</li>
    </ul>

      If the <a href="https://justincoding618.github.io/fbsplayoffreform/supplements/secondary-playoffs.html">secondary playoff solution</a> is not implemented, then consolation games for both first and second round participants are mandatory.  If the consolation bowl games are only administered for the eliminated second round participants, then only the Citrus Bowl, Alamo Bowl, ReliaQuest Bowl, and Holiday Bowl would remain and implementing the low-tier playoff solution would be required.
