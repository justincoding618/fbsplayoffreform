    <h1>Analyzing Alternative Formats</h1>
    <p>
      When the 4-team playoff was first introduced in 2014 and was expanded to a
      12-team field in 2024, there were those who suggested other formats. Some
      say an 8-team playoff would have satisfied the modernization of college
      football, while others think 12 teams is satisfactory. However, we already
      see that the 12-team field is flawed. The SEC and Big Ten proposed
      different solutions. The SEC introduced a 16-team format, and the Big Ten
      proposed multiple automatic qualifiers for the 16-team and 24-team playoff
      fields. You'll likely ask: <b>Why do I not favor the alternative smaller playoff fields?</b> Let me explain why I do not favor these alternative formats.
    </p>
    <h2>8-Team Playoff</h2>
    <p>
      The 8-team solution is most of the fans' favorable solution.  They feel that 8 teams is a good number because they see that no more than 6-8 teams are in contention for a National Championship.  There is a reason why the CFP expanded from 4 to 12 teams in 2024.  Lower divisions have already tried an 8-team playoff in the past.  Here is why 8 teams is still not enough:
      <ul>
          <li>History proves it's unstable.  Division I FCS tried it for exactly ONE season (1981) before expanding</li>
          <li>Too exclusive with 10 FBS conferences; multiple conference champions (including power conferences) would be excluded</li>
          <li>Would provide only 5.9% playoff access (8/136 = 5.9%), even worse than the current 8.8%</li>
          <li>No NCAA division has found 8 teams sustainable long-term</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>12-Team Playoff</h2>
    <p>The CFP officially expanded to 12 teams in 2024.  However, each of the two seasons provided flaws to why the 12-team playoff didn't work.  Both seasons have the following in common:
      <ul>
        <li>Conference championships become redundant when both conference championship game participants can potentially become playoff-bound (2024 and 2025 saw both the SEC and Big Ten Champion and runner-up in regardless)</li>
        <li>Bye teams struggle with long layoffs (1-7 record in quarterfinals)</li>
        <li>Teams 13-16 have legitimate exclusion grievances</li>
        <li>Only 5 conferences get autobids out of 10—arbitrary selection</li>
        <li>Access is shrinking as FBS grows (9.0% in 2024 → 8.8% in 2025)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 12-team playoff also provided controversies as well.  In the 2024-25 playoff field, the top four conference championships earn a bye to the quarterfinals.  This means that even if the 3rd of 4th highest ranked conference champions are not in the top four, they would still earn a first round bye.  Mountain West Champion Boise State and Big 12 Champion Arizona State earned the top four seeds despite both ranking outside of the top five.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2025-26 fixed it with straight-seeding.  However, it didn't come without controversy.  While the top eight teams were settled, the final two at-large spots came down to three teams.  Notre Dame was ranked ahead of Alabama and Miami (FL) for the majority of the regular season.  However, after the regular season finale, the committee decided to rank Alabama ahead of Notre Dame, ranking Alabama at #9 and Notre Dame at #10, while Miami (FL) was still slighty behind at #12 and BYU was ranked #11.  Concluding the conference championship games, the committee decided to give Alabama the penultimate at-large bid despite Alabama and BYU losing their conference championship game in blowout fashion.  Basically, the committee did not penalize Alabama, but decided to penalize BYU by dropping them down one spot, leaving the final at-large bid to Notre Dame or Miami (FL).  The committee gave Miami (FL) the final at-large spot, and along with BYU, Notre Dame was completely left out of the playoff field.  Notre Dame decided to opt out of the bowl game after being snubbed from a playoff spot.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Notre Dame deciding to not participate in a bowl game made major impact in the college football landscape.  Basically, if the team does not make the playoffs, they can decide to decline bowl invitations.  For conferences, they can issue out fines to teams deciding to not participate.  In 2024, the Sun Belt fined Marshall $100k for opting out of a bowl game.  The Big 12 fined Kansas State and Iowa State $500k for opting out of bowl games in 2025.  Because Notre Dame football was an Independent, they are free to opt out of the bowl game without reprucussions even though most of their other sports are in the ACC (except for Men's Ice Hockey, which is in the Big Ten).
    </p>
    <p>
      The 12-team field stays for the 2026 season.  However, the rules that went into effect for the 2026-27 CFP provided more exclusivity that favors the power conferences.  For the 2026-27 field, the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, and SEC Champions automatically get in, while the highest ranked non-power FBS conference champion would get the final automatic bid.  In addition, Notre Dame would earn an automatic bid if it ranks within the Top 12 of the final regular season rankings.  Guaranteeing them access while capping non-power conferences at one bid is indefensible.  The new CFP rules essentially say: "We'll give one non-power conference a pity bid, guarantee Notre Dame access regardless of merit, and reserve the other 10 spots for power conferences." This is all about protecting power conference revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten provided solutions to resolve issues present in the 12-team CFP.  However, the solutions provide completely different directions for solving the problem.  Let's look at why the 16-team and the 24-team solutions come up short.
    </p>
    <h2>16-Team Playoff</h2>
    <p>
      The SEC and Big Ten both proposed a 16-team playoff.  However, they had different visions.  Initially, both were open to utilizing multiple automatic qualifiers.  Initially, the SEC and Big Ten proposed 14 teams, where the multiple automatic qualifier would have looked like the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Conference</th>
          <th>Number of Automatic Bids</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ACC</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Big Ten</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Big 12</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>SEC</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-Power FBS</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>At-Large</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
      The Big Ten pushed it a bit further with multiple automatic bids.  The new automatic bid composition would be the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Conference</th>
          <th>Number of Automatic Bids</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ACC</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Big Ten</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Big 12</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>SEC</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-Power FBS</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>At-Large</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2025 SEC Spring Meetings, the SEC coaches were not in favor of the multiple automatic qualifiers.  The SEC then proposed a different 16-team format.  The 16-team playoff would utilize the 5+11 format.  When the other conferences have heard of the format, they were all in favor of the 5+11 format.  Overall, this is the better 16-team solution.  However, I am still not in favor of a 16-team playoff regardless.  Here is why I'm not in favor:
      <ul>
        <li>Impossible math with 10 conferences</li>
        <li>Big Ten's Proposal: Multiple auto-bids for power conferences, but still only leaving one automatic bid for the non-power FBS conferences</li>
        <li>SEC's proposal: 5 power autobids + 1 non-power FBS autobid + 11 at-large (which non-power FBS conference feasibly gets the autobid? Creates arbitrary selection)</li>
        <li>If all 10 conferences got autobids: only 6 at-large spots remaining, which is insufficient for power conference depth</li>
        <li>Either excludes conferences (two-tier system) or squeezes at-large opportunities (insufficient merit-based selection)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The SEC's 16-team proposal also keeps conference championship games, meaning the best teams in each conference play an extra high-stakes elimination game the week before the playoff while teams that missed their conference title game get extra rest. This creates the worst possible rest disparity that penalizes excellence and rewards mediocrity.
    </p>
    <h2>24-Team Playoff</h2>
    <p>
      The 24-team format is the Big Ten's solution.  The Big Ten initially continued to double down on multiple automatic bids.  The automatic bid composition for the 24-team field would be the following:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Conference</th>
          <th>Number of Automatic Bids</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ACC</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Big Ten</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Big 12</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>SEC</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-Power FBS</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>At-Large</td>
          <td>6</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Ten's 24-team proposal of multiple automatic bids created fundamental problems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Undermines conference championships:</b> If 4 teams per conference automatically qualify, winning your conference provides minimal advantage over finishing 4th</li>
      <li><b>Removes meritocracy:</b> A 9-3 team finishing 4th in the Big Ten gets an autobid while an 11-1 team from another conference competes for at-large spots</li>
      <li><b>Creates massive inequity:</b> 16 power conference autobids vs. 2 non-power autobids = formal two-tier system</li>
      <li><b>Only 6 at-large spots total:</b> With 16 power autobids + 2 non-power autobids = 18 autobids, leaving only 6 at-large spots for the entire rest of FBS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Recently, the Big Ten stepped away from the multiple automatic qualifer format. In February 2026, the Big Ten is proposing a 23+1 model for the 24-team format.  The best 23 teams would be selected and one bid would go to the non-power FBS team.  While that is a better proposal, it still undermines the non-power FBS teams as they would only have one guaranteed bid.
    </p>
    <h3>The Bye Week Layoff Problem</h3>
    <p>
      If we still want to keep the Army-Navy game as the stand-alone regular season finale, a 24-team playoff with the top 8 teams receiving first-round byes still creates massive and unequal layoffs:
    </p>
    <p><b>Since conference championship games would be eliminated, this is a step in the right direction.  However, it still creates rest disparities even if all conference championship games are eliminated:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Teams with first-round byes:</b> 3-week layoff (regular season finale → bye → second round)</li>
      <li><b>Teams playing in first round:</b> 2-week gap (regular season finale → first round)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>If conference championship games are kept:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Teams with byes that played in championship games:</b> 3-week layoff (championship game → bye → second round)</li>
      <li><b>Teams with byes that didn't play in championship games:</b> 4-week layoff (regular season finale → bye → second round)</li>
      <li><b>First-round teams that played in championship games:</b> 2-week gap (championship game → first round)</li>
      <li><b>First-round teams that didn't play in championship games:</b> 3-week layoff (regular season finale → first round)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This creates unequal rest periods based on conference championship participation, compounding the bye advantage/disadvantage with additional disparities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The rust problem:</b> Extended layoffs cause rhythm and timing issues. In the current 12-team playoff, teams with first-round byes have gone 1-7 in quarterfinals (excluding Indiana). A 3-4 week layoff is even worse than the current 2-3 week gap.  Even with championship games eliminated, the 3-week bye period in a 24-team format still creates significant competitive imbalance.
    </p>
  <h3>Other Problems with 24 Teams</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bracket structure complications:</b> Creates seeding and scheduling challenges</li>
    <li><b>The gap between seed 8 (bye) and seed 9 (no bye):</b> This becomes the new controversy, just shifted from "who gets in" to "who gets the bye"</li>
    <li><b>Conference championship games and play-in games become completely redundant:</b> With the conference champion and conference runner up both making the playoffs for at least most power conferences, the championship game and play-in games are meaningless for playoff qualification</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>Summary:</b> The 24-team format attempts to solve the Big Ten's access concerns but creates worse problems: unequal layoffs, bye-induced rust, multiple autobids undermining conference championships (with conference play-in games making the solution worse), and massive competitive imbalance. The elixir is worse than the disease.
  </p>
    <h2>The Multiple Automatic Bid Problem</h2>
    <h3>Why Multiple Autobids Don't Work</h3>
    <p>
      The Big Ten's initial intent to double down on multiple automatic bids is an extremely bad idea.  <b>Not all teams who finish in the top two, three, or four in each power conference are the top 16 teams.  In addition, implementing play-in games for the playoffs would make the problem much worse.  What if at least one of the top three or four teams in the Big Ten or SEC finished with four losses or worse or there was a three-way tie for third in the SEC or Big Ten (regardless of play-in games)?  The play-in games should be a complete non-starter.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    I understand that the playoff field would be more appealing if only power conferences are the only teams to have access to automatic bids.  However, it would be completely unfair to leave out the non-power FBS teams for automatic bids.  The SEC did redeem themselves by doing a better job of proposing a better format.  They proposed a 5+11 format, which would still reward the best teams into the field and has gained support from nearly all the FBS conferences.  The Big Ten initially remained stubborn about multiple automatic bids before eventually proposing the 23+1 format in February 2026.  
    </p>
    <h3>The Unpredictability Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Automatic bids are basically the way of saying, “Regardless of how good or bad your regular season goes, you’re in if you meet this one said criterion.”  If you try to do multiple automatic bids for at least one conference, what if at least one of those top four teams in a said conference had at least four losses?  Take a look at the Big East in 2010.  The top three teams in the Big East all went 8-4 by the end of the regular season.  UConn went on to win the conference’s automatic bid for a BCS bowl game despite being unranked in the final BCS standings.  Power conferences also had history of at least one of the top three teams finishing with more than two losses.  <b>There is no guarantee that every season would play out the way you wanted it to.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Ten's initial push for multiple automatic bids does not cover unexpected surprises.  It can cover seasons where the power conferences do well, but not when at least one of the power conferences have a run of at least one surprising down season.  At the same time, it does not cover seasons where non-power FBS conferences can potentially have a run where they have at least one surprising elite season.  In general, power conferences can be like non-power FBS conferences where they can have a run where they have at least one down season.  Once again, there is no guarantee that every season would play out the way you wanted it to.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In an ideal scenario, every conference champion should have a chance to make the playoffs (yes, even non-power FBS conferences).  If they make it, they should also have a chance for a National Championship.  Power conferences having multiple automatic bids is a terrible idea.  It doesn’t matter how much someone claims that their conference is the best and/or toughest.  If a team in the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, or ACC finishes 4th in the conference standings despite going 7-5, 6-6, or even 7-6, that 7-5, 7-6, and/or 6-6 team would automatically get in over a more deserving team that is 9-3 or 10-2. 
    </p>
    <h3>The Equity and Funding Problem</h3>
    <p>
      College football is definitely the biggest money maker out of all the collegiate sports.  However, non-power FBS conference teams need money to be able to fund their athletic departments as well as getting media exposure.   What would happen if you decide to take more postseason opportunities (to play for a national championship) away from those schools by only providing one or two automatic bids to the entire non-power FBS conference pool?  Especially if power conferences could go to a conference only regular season schedule, the non-power FBS teams are going to eventually have to give up on fielding a football team (or in the absolute worst-case scenario, permanently shut down their universities) because of the lack of funding and media exposure.  You may think, “too bad for them”, but that mindset will only add insult to injury.
    </p>

    <p><b>The 32 team playoff field solves all these problems.  It would provide the following:</b>
