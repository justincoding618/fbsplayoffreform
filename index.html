      <h1>FBS Postseason Reform Overview</h1>
      <p>
        College football is a spectacle where fans of all ages have passion and
        fervor. Since the pioneering of college football in 1869, it has
        blossomed as a dedicated event across the United States. However, there
        have been growing demands to improve the college football season,
        especially the postseason, as current and past systems have come up
        short of determining the best teams to play for a National Championship.
        To best serve the modernization of college football, I want to formally
        introduce the 32-team Division I FBS playoff and low-tier playoff
        systems. The 32-team playoff would begin on the first weekend of
        December and conclude by mid-January, maximizing revenue, preserving
        competitive balance, and maintaining unity of Division I FBS. The
        low-tier playoff systems would provide teams additional postseason
        opportunities for those who did not make the FBS playoffs.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Current playoff formats—whether 4, 12, 16, or 24 teams—all create
        problems they claim to solve. The 12-team format has already exposed
        critical flaws: bye teams struggling with extended layoffs (going 1-7 in
        quarterfinals), conference championship games becoming redundant when
        both participants make the playoff, and deserving teams being excluded
        by arbitrary selection criteria. Smaller formats provide too much
        exclusivity, while proposed larger formats with byes create competitive
        imbalances. The answer isn't tweaking the existing system—it's building
        one that solves these problems from the ground up.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution: 32-Team Playoff</h2>
      <p>The 32-team playoff format provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Universal Access:</b> All 10 FBS conference champions earn
          automatic bids
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Merit-Based Selection:</b> 22 at-large bids ensure deserving teams
          aren't excluded
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Competitive Balance:</b> Top 16 teams seeded with home-field
          advantage; no byes eliminate rest disparities
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revenue Growth:</b> Performance-based payouts benefit the entire
          FBS ecosystem
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Preserves Tradition:</b> Bowl games remain integral to
          quarterfinals and semifinals
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Regular Season Matters:</b> Seeding determines home games, bowl
          selection, and matchup paths
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <h3>Season Structure</h3>
      <p>
        12-game regular season (with options to expand up to 14 games) ending
        the weekend before Thanksgiving, followed by the Army-Navy standalone
        finale. This creates a natural bye week giving all teams equal rest
        entering the playoffs.

          >View detailed season structure →</a
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Playoff Format</h3>
      <p>Five rounds from early December through mid-January:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>First and Second Rounds:</b> Campus sites (higher seed hosts) - 16
          first-round games, 8 second-round games
        </li>
        <li><b>Quarterfinals:</b> New Year's Six Bowl Games - 4 games</li>
        <li>
          <b>Semifinals:</b> Rose Bowl + Rotating NY6 Bowl - 2 games on New
          Year's Day
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Championship:</b> Pre-determined neutral site - Second Friday or
          Saturday of January
        </li>
      </ul>

        >
      </p>

      <h3>Selection Process</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Automatic Bids:</b> All 10 FBS conference champions (regular season
        champions; tiebreakers applied as needed)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>At-Large Bids:</b> 22 teams selected by committee based on final
        regular season rankings
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Seeding:</b> Top 16 teams seeded 1-16; teams 17-32 unseeded. Seeding
        determines home-field advantage (rounds 1-2) and bowl selection rights
        (rounds 3-4).

      </p>

      <h3>Revenue Distribution</h3>
      <p>
        Performance-based model with payouts ranging from $7M (first round) to
        $18M (championship game). Teams accumulate earnings as they advance,
        with a championship participant earning $60M total for their conference.
        This creates powerful incentives while ensuring all playoff participants
        receive meaningful revenue.

      <h2>Why 32 Teams?</h2>
      <p>
        Alternative formats of 8, 12, 16, or 24 teams all create problems they
        claim to solve. Eight teams is too exclusive, excluding multiple
        conference champions. Twelve teams creates bye-week rust and arbitrary
        selection. Sixteen teams forces impossible math with 10 conferences.
        Twenty-four teams creates massive layoff disparities and undermines
        conference championships. A 32-team field solves these issues while
        maintaining what makes college football special: the regular season
        still matters tremendously through seeding, teams prove themselves on
        the field rather than in committee rooms, and tradition is preserved
        through bowl integration.

      <h2>Key Innovations</h2>

      <h3>Equal Rest, No Byes</h3>
      <p>
        All teams enter the playoff with equal rest and play the same number of
        games. This eliminates the bye-week rust problem plaguing the current
        format where bye teams have gone 1-7 in quarterfinals.

      <h3>Eliminating Conference Championships (Recommended)</h3>
      <p>
        Conference championship games become redundant when both participants
        often make the playoff. Awarding automatic bids to regular season
        champions eliminates this redundancy and creates equal rest for all
        teams.

          championship games →</a
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Home-Field Advantage for Top Seeds</h3>
      <p>
        The top 16 seeds host first-round games, with seeds 1-8 guaranteed two
        home games if they keep winning. Home teams won 6-2 in the first round
        of the current playoff, demonstrating the tangible advantage. This
        rewards regular season excellence while creating electric campus
        atmospheres.
      </p>

      <h3>Bowl Game Integration</h3>
      <p>
        New Year's Six bowls host quarterfinals and semifinals, preserving
        tradition while raising stakes. The highest seed in each quarterfinal
        matchup selects which bowl to play in, adding strategic considerations.

      </ul>

      <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
      <p>
        The 32-team playoff represents more than expansion—it represents a
        fundamental rethinking of how college football determines its champion.
        By ensuring universal access through automatic bids, rewarding
        excellence through seeding, maintaining competitive balance through
        equal rest, and preserving tradition through bowl integration, this
        format serves the entire FBS ecosystem rather than just a privileged
        few.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice is clear: continue with flawed systems that create new
        problems while claiming to solve old ones, or embrace a comprehensive
        solution that makes college football better for players, schools,
        conferences, and fans.
