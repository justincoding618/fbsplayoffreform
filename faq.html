          <b>Q: Isn't 32 teams too many?</b>
        </summary>
        <p>
          No, because every lower NCAA division followed similar evolutionary paths, expanding their playoffs as membership grew and conferences multiplied.

            <b>Q: Would the 32-team playoff devalue the regular season?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            <b>The opposite is true.</b> The regular season can determine:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Conference championships:</b> Winners get automatic bids
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>At-large selection:</b> 22 competitive spots based on
              committee rankings
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Seeding (1-16):</b> Determines who gets home-field
              advantage
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Top 8 vs. Top 16:</b> Difference between two home games
              and one
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Seeded vs. Unseeded:</b> Massive difference between seed
              16 (home game) and being the top unseeded team (road game)
            </li>
          </ul>

            <b>Q: What about conferences that want to keep championship games?</b>
          </summary>
            <p>
            My proposal recommends eliminating conference championship games to avoid scheduling conflicts and bye week issues. However, conferences that insist on keeping them (like the SEC) can do so. The winner would still receive the automatic bid to the FBS playoff. However, for conferences that do want to hold conference championship games, the teams that do not make it will play one less game than teams in conferences that only determine the champion concluding the regular season.</p>
            <p><b>The optimal solution remains determining conference champions through regular season records with tiebreakers, as this eliminates these complications.</b></p>

            <b>Q: How does this compare to other NCAA divisions?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            FBS currently has the <b>worst playoff access in NCAA football</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>FCS (129 teams): 24-team playoff = 18.6% access</li>
            <li>Division II (161 teams): 32-team playoff = 19.9% access</li>
            <li>Division III (241 teams): 40-team playoff = 16.6% access</li>
            <li>FBS (136 teams): 12-team playoff = <b>8.8% access</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Division II just expanded to 32 teams in 2025 with 16 conferences. FBS has 136 teams and 10 conferences.  The math works even better. <a href="/playoff-access-history.html">See full historical analysis →</a>

            <b>Q: Won't this kill the bowl system?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            No, the bowl system is <b>enhanced, not eliminated</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The New Year's Six bowls (Rose, Sugar, Orange, Cotton, Peach, Fiesta) host quarterfinals and semifinals on a rotating basis</li>
            <li>Secondary playoff systems provide additional postseason opportunities.  11 Bowl Games would be in each of the secondary playoff systems.</li>
            <li>Traditional bowls continue for teams that neither make the FBS playoffs nor secondary playoff systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is similar to college basketball, where the NCAA Tournament coexists with the NIT and other postseason tournaments. <a href="/supplements/secondary-playoffs.html">Learn about secondary playoff options →</a>

            <b>Q: What about the SEC and Big Ten disagreement?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            The current impasse proves why partial solutions fail. The SEC wants 16 teams, the Big Ten wants 24 teams.  Neither solves the fundamental problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 32-team format gives both what they need:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>SEC gets depth:</b> 22 at-large bids means they can send 6-8 teams in strong years</li>
            <li><b>Big Ten gets access:</b> Same broad opportunities without needing guaranteed multiple autobids; they also get depth like the SEC</li>
            <li><b>All 10 conferences get guaranteed autobids</b></li>
            <li><b>No one needs to break away</b></li>
          </ul>

              <b>Q: Why not 8, 12, 16, or 24 teams instead of 32?</b>
            </summary>
            <p>
              Each alternative format has been proposed or implemented, and each creates significant problems that 32 teams solves:
            </p>
            
            <p><b>8 teams:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>History proves it's unstable—FCS tried it for exactly ONE season (1981) before expanding</li>
              <li>Too exclusive with 10 FBS conferences; multiple conference champions would be excluded</li>
              <li>Would provide only 5.9% playoff access (136 teams ÷ 8), even worse than the current 8.8%</li>
              <li>No NCAA division has found 8 teams sustainable long-term</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>12 teams (current format):</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conference championships become redundant when both participants are playoff-bound (2024 and 2025 saw both the SEC and Big Ten Champion and runner-up in the playoff field regardless)</li>
              <li>Bye teams struggle with long layoffs (1-7 record in quarterfinals)</li>
              <li>Teams 13-16 have legitimate exclusion grievances</li>
              <li>Only 5 conferences get autobids out of 10—arbitrary selection</li>
              <li>Access is shrinking as FBS grows (9.0% in 2024 → 8.8% in 2025)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>16 teams:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Impossible math with 10 conferences</li>
              <li>Big Ten's (and SEC's Initial) Proposal: Multiple automatic bids for power conferences, but still only leaving one automatic bid for the non-power FBS conferences</li>
              <li>SEC's proposal: 5 automatic bids (however, only one automatic bid is for the non-power FBS conferences) + 11 at-large (which non-power FBS conference feasibly gets the automatic bid? Creates arbitrary selection)</li>
              <li>If all 10 conferences got autobids: only 6 at-large spots remaining, which is insufficient for power conference depth</li>
              <li>Either excludes conferences (two-tier system) or squeezes at-large opportunities (insufficient merit-based selection)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>24 teams:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Top 8 teams get first-round byes, creating massive competitive imbalance</li>
              <li>The gap between seed 8 (bye) and seed 9 (no bye) becomes the new controversy</li>
              <li>Big Ten's proposal includes 4 autobids per power conference and only two for non-power FBS conferences, which undermines the concept of "conference champion" and removes meritocracy</li>
              <li>Bracket structure complications with uneven teams</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Why 32 teams solves all these problems:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>10 autobids for all conference champions (access and equity)</li>
              <li>22 at-large bids (merit-based selection, sufficient for power conference depth)</li>
              <li>No byes: everyone plays the same number of games (competitive balance)</li>
              <li>Top 16 teams seeded with home-field advantage (rewards regular season)</li>
              <li>23.5% playoff access (though more generous than Division I FCS, Division II, and Division III, it is still in line with NCAA norms of 16-20%)</li>
              <li>
                Follows proven precedent:        
                <ul>
                  <li> Division II (161 teams) just expanded to 32 in 2025</li>
                  <li> Division III (241 teams) has done 32 teams from 2005-23 until expanding to 40 teams to make room for at-large bids</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <b>Q: How long would the playoff last?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            The playoff would last from the first weekend of December through the second Friday/Saturday of January:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>First Round:</b> First weekend of December (Wed-Sat)</li>
            <li><b>Second Round:</b> Second week of December (Wed-Sat)</li>
            <li><b>Quarterfinals:</b> Third weekend of December (Fri-Sat)</li>
            <li><b>Semifinals:</b> January 1 (or January 2 if New Year's falls on Sunday)</li>
            <li><b>National Championship:</b> Second Friday or Saturday of January</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The national champion and runner-up would play 17-19 total games (12-14 game regular season + 5 playoff games), comparable to FCS champions and within established NCAA and NFL norms.
          </p>

          <summary>
            <b>Q: Isn't this too many games for student-athletes?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            The national champion and runner-up would play no more than 17-19 games total (12-14 game regular season + 5 playoff games). For comparison:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>FCS champions and runner-ups play 16 or 17 games (12 regular + 4 or 5 playoff games)</li>
            <li>Division II champions and runner-ups play 16 games (11 regular + 5 playoff games)</li>
            <li>Division III champions and runner-ups play 15 or 16 games (10 regular + 5 or 6 playoff games)</li>
            <li>NFL teams play up to 21 games (17 regular season games + up to 4 playoff games)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NCAA already has protocols for managing player workload and injury risk across multiple divisions. This is a solved problem, not a new challenge.

          <summary>
            <b>Q: Why not expand beyond 32 teams?</b>
          </summary>
          <p>
            While larger fields are theoretically possible, they create significant scheduling and structural problems that make 32 teams the optimal stopping point for FBS:
          </p>
          <p><b>The Context: Why Division III's Path Doesn't Apply to FBS</b></p>
          <p>
            Division III successfully expanded from 32 to 40 teams (adding a 6th round) in 2024, but their situation was fundamentally different from FBS:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Division III's problem:</b> 28 conferences with autobids left only 4 at-large spots in a 32-team field—a 7:1 autobid-to-at-large ratio. Teams were being systematically excluded despite strong records.</li>
            <li><b>Division III's future:</b> If they ever expanded to 64 teams, the ratio would be 28 autobids + 36 at-large (44% autobids, 56% at-large)—still a healthy balance given their conference structure. However, this expansion is not currently in NCAA's plans.</li>
            <li><b>FBS's situation:</b> 10 conferences with autobids in a 32-team field creates 22 at-large spots—a 1:2.2 ratio (31% autobids, 69% at-large). FBS already has plenty of at-large opportunities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>The key difference:</b> Division III has 28 conferences competing for limited at-large spots. FBS has only 10 conferences, so expanding beyond 32 teams would create an excessive number of at-large bids relative to automatic qualifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Division III <i>needed</i> expansion to provide adequate at-large selection. FBS expanding beyond 32 would dilute the value of conference championships by making at-large selection easier.
          </p>
          <p><b>The Scheduling Problem:</b></p>
          <p>
            Expanding beyond 32 teams requires either:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Moving Army-Navy to stand-alone season opener:</b> This eliminates the traditional standalone finale that honors both academies. While this would allow the playoff to start Thanksgiving weekend (creating more scheduling room), it sacrifices a beloved tradition.</li>
            <li><b>Moving Army-Navy as the Friday Night stand-alone game during the regular season finale (with or without conference championship games):</b> This would still keep traditional standalone finale that honors both academies. However, other teams would not be allowed to schedule any games during that day. </li>
            <li><b>Keeping Army-Navy after Thanksgiving:</b> This forces the playoff's final three rounds to compress into the current 12-team schedule (late December through early January), eliminating the weekly rhythm and creating travel/preparation issues.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><b>The Rose Bowl Problem:</b></p>
          <p>
            The Rose Bowl's New Year's Day tradition is non-negotiable for many. A playoff beyond 32 teams would either:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Push semifinals past New Year's Day (breaking tradition)</li>
            <li>Compress earlier rounds into impossible timeframes</li>
            <li>Require starting the playoff during Thanksgiving week (we would have to move the Army-Navy game)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Why 32 Is the Sweet Spot for FBS:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fits within existing schedule constraints (Army-Navy stays after Thanksgiving, Rose Bowl stays New Year's Day)</li>
            <li>Healthy autobid-to-at-large ratio (31% autobids maintains conference championship importance)</li>
            <li>23.5% playoff access (slightly above but comparable to NCAA norms of 16-20%)</li>
            <li>Five-round bracket structure is mathematically clean and traditional</li>
            <li>Solves FBS's actual problem (access + depth) without creating new problems (excessive at-large bids)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            <b>The bottom line:</b> Division III expanded to 40 teams because they had too few at-large spots. FBS expanding beyond 32 would create too many at-large spots, which would further undermine the value of conference championships. 32 teams is the optimal size given FBS's specific structure and constraints.
          </p>
          <p><b>However, If Expansion Beyond 32 Becomes Inevitable:</b></p>
          <p>
            Here is how we can do this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>39 Teams:</b> 
              <ul>
                <li>7 play-in games to get to 32</li>
                <li>CFP Top 25 becomes the benchmark for seeding/byes</li>
                <li>Teams that make it to the playoffs ranked outside the Top 25 must survive the Play-In Series (including unranked Conference Champions)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>40 Teams:</b>               
              <ul>
                <li>8 play-in games to get to 32</li>
                <li>CFP Top 20 becomes the new benchmark for seeding/byes</li>
                <li>Last 4 byes become highly competitive</li>
                <li>Teams that are outside the Top 24 must survive the Play-In Series (including unranked Conference Champions)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This structure would be a hybrid between NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments and the NBA's Play-In Tournament models.  Teams that meet the ranking threshold (Top 25 for 39 teams, Top 20 for 40 teams) clinch a playoff spot outright.  For the 40-team field, the top four teams ranked outside the top 20 would clinch the final outright playoff spots.  For teams that meet outside that threshold for the 39-team or 40-team field, they must survive the Play-In Series to earn their spot in the main 32-team field.  The Play-In Series games can be hosted either at campus sites (like the first two rounds of the main playoff), which keeps the format consistent and gives those play-in teams home-field advantage if they earned it through seeding, or through bowl games, where 7 (for the 39-team field) or 8 more bowl games (for the 40-team field) would be involved in the playoff field.  For bowl games, the higher ranked team would be the designated home team and the winner of those bowl games would advance to the 32-team field.
